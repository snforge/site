This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring a career in designing and managing business processes, either directly (V.P. of Ops, COO) or indirectly (e.g. management consulting). The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between operations and other business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. Finally, a working knowledge of operations, which typically employs the greatest number of employees and requires the largest investment in assets, is indispensable for general managers and entrepreneurs. We will see how different business strategies require different business processes, and vice versa, how different operational capabilities allow and support different strategies to gain competitive advantage. A process view of operations will be used to analyze different key operational dimensions such as capacity management, flow time management, supply chain management, and quality management. We will also discuss developments such as lean operations, just-in-time operations, and time-based competition. Class is now in session!

I have been using Photoshop since version 3 and every time it gets better and better. I have created litterally thousands of designs and over that time I have found that there are number of key skills and tools us web designers use in almost every design. This is why I created, along with the team at Web Courses, a series of screencast tutorials ideal for beginner web designers who wants to Learn Web Design with Photoshop. 1. The Power of File and New In this lesson, you will learn how to open a new document and apply the settings you need to set up before you start designing in Photoshop. 2. Changing, Using and Installing Brushes A look at paintbrushes. The different types of brushes that you can use as well as installing some new brushes, so you can do some really nice affects on your design. 3. The Key to Custom Shapes Shapes is something we use a lot when we're designing a web page. It's used to make the layout and lots of other elements on the screen. We get used to this really useful tool in this lesson. 4. The Core of Photoshop, Layers and Groups Layers are the most important part of Photoshop, as they allow you to make changes to specific areas on the screen. You can further group these layers together to make it more manageable when you're designing. 5. The Shortcuts to Moving and Resizing In this lesson we're going to be looking at how to move layers around the screen and how to resize them using the free transform tool, something you will use a lot in your designs. 6. Getting the Most from Zooming and Panning We are going to look at how to look around your design and see the details by using the zoom tool. So in this lesson we look into two very important features of using Photoshop daily, zooming and panning. 7. Creating Cool Effects with Blending Modes Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other and effects are different things you can apply to single layer, things like shadows, inners shadows, gradients etc. 8. Text, Love it or Hate it Texts are one of the trickiest things in Photoshop, reason being that its not really made to do it. So in this lesson, we're going to find easy ways to work with Photoshop and texts. 9. Clean Web Page Design using Photoshop We are going to be creating a webpage design in Photoshop. We are going to use grids to organize everything and get things in line and various other tricks to make the perfect web page.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/15639_13f2_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/photoshop-for-web-design-beginners/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Photoshop"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":5096,"isFree":true,"matches":["37733906-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376aad81-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b59-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc58-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad491-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37702bc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"photoshop-for-web-design-beginners"},{"id":"376e5708-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"14255","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.584Z","updated":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Gephi 中文教程","headline":"介绍Gephi的基本使用方法，有大量实际操作的视频演示，便于初学者快速入门。","description":"Gephi 是一款网络分析领域的数据可视化处理软件，开发者对它寄予的希望是：成为 “数据可视化领域的Photoshop” 。 为推动 Gephi 在中文领域的发展，分享实验室  以MOOC模式在  udemy.com  推出了Gephi中文视频教程。Gephi中文教程介绍了Gephi是什么样的软件，提供什么样的功能，各项主要功能的操作方式等等。  Gephi中文教程采用  CC BY-NC 3.0  版权的协议发布。关于此 Gephi 中文教程如果您有任何问题或建议，可以通过电子邮件（ digitip#gmail.com ）与讲者取得联系，也可以在一些社交网络比如推特微博等查找 @ooof 获取他的更多消息。  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/14255_e073_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/gephi/","language":"zh","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Data Visualization"],"rating":4.7,"reviews":4695,"isFree":true,"matches":["376ecc33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37792c7a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37784216-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b746-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37795386-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779c8bc-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37792c79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"gephi"},{"id":"3775aa04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"26433","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.937Z","updated":"2015-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Become a Paid Life Coach Online","headline":"A Step-by-Step Life Coaching Training For Becoming a Life Coach and Starting Your Own Coaching Business","description":"Welcome to the Become a Paid Life Coach Online video life coaching training program, your guide to becoming a life coach.

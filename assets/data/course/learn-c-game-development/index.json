The course teaches you how to use the SFML library for C++, to start working with graphics, events and sound to create a 2D game. Everything is done step by step with the help of videos, so it's easy to follow along and learn. At the end of the course you will know what you need for game programming and will be able to start making your own games. Warning: This course was published more than 2 years ago and the technology used in it progresses fast. The current most updated version of SFML (2.1) doesn't work out of the box with Visual Studio 2013 (or the express editions) and it requires more work to setup. If you want to follow this course easily, then you should use the 2012 or older version of Visual Studio (or the express edition) which can still be officially downloaded from Microsoft site.

Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, you’ll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, you’ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, you’ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

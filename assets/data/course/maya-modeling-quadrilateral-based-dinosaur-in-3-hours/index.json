Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"3771d976-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19878","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.695Z","updated":"2017-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Introduction to Blender","headline":"Introduction to Blender - Arabic","description":"This is an introductory course for Blender 3D user interface and modelling, you will learn the basic modeling techniques in addition to a quick tour about blender user interface, you need to be familiar with windows in order to download and setup blender 3D application that is available for free on blender official website.

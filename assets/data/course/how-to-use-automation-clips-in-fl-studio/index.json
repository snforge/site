Our video tutorials will bring you right into the world of PLC explaining what you need to know to understand the fundamentals. This PLC course is a step-by-step introduction to controllers, built on a everyday experience of a practicing automation experts! So What is a PLC?A programmable logic controller, also called a PLC or programmable controller, is a computer-type device used to control equipment in an industrial facility. The kinds of equipment that PLCs can control are as varied as industrial facilities themselves. Conveyor systems, food processing machinery, auto assembly lines…you name it and there’s probably a PLC out there controlling it.What is this PLC Course about? This innovative PLC online training, is addressed to all automation enthusiasts. The tutorial is based on Siemen's LOGO! 12/24 RC and Siemens S7-1200. If you are thinking about working in automation industry, you have to deal with PLCs. If you work or study, and wondering if- and how - to start your adventure with PLC, see our course! All over the world, the continuing development of industrial automation makes PLC training a good investment.What does this course teach? Provides you a complete introduction to understanting PLC logic and career building skills needed for this industry. Creating your first projects will teach you solving real world problems in practical projects you may encounter when working with PLC's. What will I learn in this course?First programs – basic instructions and challenges filmed using Siemens LOGO Training kit for visualization How to assemble a PLC device What are the uses of programmable controllers in industry and building automation How to write programs in LOGO! Soft Comfort Functions used in programming Fundamentals of ladder logic How to work with analog inputs and timers More Advanced topics for S7-1200Familiarize with S7‐1200 PLC and TiA Portal software (available CPU’s,extension modules, Tia software, comparison with S7‐300 and STEP 5)Easy start with TiA (description of main parts of the screen – project tree,instructions, program view)Parameterization of PLC (hardware parameters, create hardware set insoftware)Hardware parameterization part 1 (I/O, PROFINET‐interface, onlinediagnostics, time‐settings)Hardware parameterization part 2 (memory bytes, generators, protection,web‐server)Watch and force tableWriting your first programs – basic instructions and challenges Introduction - LADDER, FBD, SCL– definitions and historyOrganization of memory in PLCOB,FB,DB,FC – how to useCopy input signals to outputs (open coil)Switching output on each pulse of input signal (P/N-slopes)Activation hardware generators – special memoryProgram for turn signal on basis of system in cars (S/R coils)Operations\non variablesIintroduction to variables (int,dint,real -> byte, word, dword)Counters CTUCTUDProgram which use counters (parking) cars (S/R coils)Timers and other usefull operations! The list goes on please take a look at the Curriculum of this course.Autors of This is PLC Course Compilation are: Szymon Kurpisz raduate of Poznan University of Technology at the Faculty of Mechanical Engeeniring and Management.  Jakub Chmielewski by is a graduate od Wroclaw University of Technology and Otto von Guericke University From the Autors: \"We have a few years' experience working with various programming systems used in industrial automation, from PLC to visualization systems (SCADA)... It was our intention to do this course based on practical examples, and to relate it to what I see in my work. It means introducing a measure of problem-solving to the tutorials, along with the knowledge you'll need to write the programs we will work on. We hope my course will be a good introduction to the fascinating world of logical controllers...\" New career opportunities learning PLC Industrial Automation and Control PLC devices have been present on the market for over 40 years. The need for automation propels their continuing popularity and development. PLCs are used in various industries but also in building automation. Their big advatage is that they promote green solutions.  All over the world, the continuing development of industrial automation makes PLC programming skills increasingly sought by potential employers. Want to take your career to the next level?

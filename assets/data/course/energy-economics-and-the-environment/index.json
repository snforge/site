What happens in the brain when you reframe? What are the inner and outer effects? And how do you do it? You are invited to share your most powerful reframings - either as a comment to the group or by contacting Anette Prehn at anette@anetteprehn.com This course is targeted for professionals, managers and executives which will show in the examples given and the questions asked.

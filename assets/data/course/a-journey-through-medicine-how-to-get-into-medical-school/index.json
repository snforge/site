Especially since in germany a language test for physicians was introduced. From that time on the amount of books and courses in the internet increased a lot. But what makes a course good or bad? Many times the publishers offer you a huge amount of material, but sadly without specific structure related to the important german medical language exam. With this course I want to help you having success with the german language and passing the so called Fachsprachprüfung to be able to practice medicine in germany.The course gives you a comprehensive amount of material, specific for each chapter of the medical language test in germany. The videos show you how to communicate with patients, how to translate and intonate labvalues, and how to write doctor letters. The letters are adjusted and made by doctors, working in germany since years. Additional to that, I took from multiple clinics in germany the medical administration dokuments, adjusted and combined them to one big dokument. The complete course has audio. This way you can read, write and hear in the same time.I hope the course helps you with studying more efficiantly and more successfully.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746916_e231_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/german-for-doctors/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Language","German Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37738729-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37747182-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733901-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"deutsch-fuer-mediziner-german-for-doctors"},{"id":"3775aa08-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"26454","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.937Z","updated":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn about Eastern Medicine and Energy Psychology","headline":"Learn about the principles of Eastern Medicine and the definition of Energy Psychology and its basic schools.","description":"The Principles of Eastern Medicine and The Definition of Energy Psychology course gives a general overview of Energy Psychology and the main schools of this discipline: Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Thought Field Therapy (TFT), and Neuro Emotional Technique or NET, and describes in detail and with illustrations the particulars of energy psychology, especially the principles of Eastern Medicine and Applied Kinesiology, the foundation of this discipline. The Principles of Eastern Medicine and The Definition of Energy Psychology gives a general overview of the fundamentals of Eastern Medicine.

These powerful techniques are often used in applied machine learning to achieve the best overall performance.In this unique course, after installing the necessary tools you will jump straight into the bagging method so as to get the best results from algorithms that are highly sensitive to specific data—for example, algorithms based on decision trees. Next, you will discover another powerful and popular class of ensemble methods called boosting. Here you'll achieve maximal algorithm performance by training a sequence of models, where each given model improves the results of the previous one. You will then explore a much simpler technique called voting, where results from multiple models are achieved using simple statistics such as the mean average. You will also work hands-on with algorithms such as stacking and XGBoost to improve performance.By the end of this course, you will know how to use a variety of ensemble algorithms in the real world to boost your machine learning models.Please note that a working knowledge of Python 3; the ability to run simple commands in Shell (Terminal); and also some basic machine learning experience are core prerequisites for taking and getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and programmed professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share this with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups, he was involved in. He failed miserably then. He then discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning, which he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to the “Keep it simple” mantra. He is the author of multiple bestselling video courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Real-World Deep Learning Python Projects and AI in Finance.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742004_65b9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769462-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python"},{"id":"37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27868","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.943Z","updated":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn Test Driven Development in Java","headline":"Learn everything you need to know about TDD, Test driven development tutorial for Java through real examples.","description":" This “Java Training: Test Driven Development Tutorial for Java” course provides everything you need to know to get started with test driven development in Java.

Like the textbook, the course quickly dives into problem solving and making use of the C++ standard library, including strings, vectors, and lists. The emphasis is on teaching you the parts of C++ that you will most likely need in your day-to-day programming. This course is Part 1 of a planned two-part sequence. Part 1 covers the first seven chapters of Accelerated C++, in particular, Chapters 0 through 6. The course consists of six videos of 50-60 minutes each. Part 2 of the course, forthcoming, will cover the second half of Accelerated C++, including how to write your own classes and generic functions.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/17503_7fa8_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-short-and-sweet/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C++"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":1391,"isFree":true,"matches":["376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"c-short-and-sweet-part-1"},{"id":"376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"9463","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.173Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Programming Java for Beginners - The Ultimate Java Tutorial","headline":"Learn Java Programming at your own Pace. Comes Complete with Working Files and a Verifiable Certificate of Completion.","description":" Learn the basic concepts, tools, and functions that you will need to build fully functional programs with the popular programming language, Java. Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, you’ll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, you’ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs.

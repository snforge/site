The intent is to aid anyone who is struggling in learning how to program and would like to see practical examples and demonstrations. This course is not affiliated with any university and will not provide answers to any homework assignments for any reason. Topics covered will include but not be limited to: Syntax and commands Creating variables Creating methods Working with files Exception handling Creating Classes Object-Oriented programming basics Basic Unit Testing Graphics and GUI programming In the end, this course is a stand-alone course, however it would be a huge aid to the online student who is taking a self-directed course, an individual who is trying to learn how to program, or even a high school student looking to get a head start on computer science material they might encounter in college. The material is organized in a start-to-finish fashion, building on knowledge with each section, so it is best to proceed through each section in order. Each section should amount to about a week worth of learning, lining up with most popular online course formats. Additionally, the course works hard to build practical knowledge that will help a student excel in their coursework, and also builds a strong foundation for a start to a career in programming for anyone looking to learn! As an added bonus, several useful programs are built throughout this course, and the end result of the course includes full source code for a working Sudoku game, amongst other programs, such as card game score calculators and basics physics formula calculation programs.

This course will concentrate on Technical Analysis, and you will learn everything I know about correctly reading stock charts in about 80 minutes!  By training yourself to read and correctly interpret the information charts give you, you will be able to predict which way a stock will most likely move in the near future.  Charts can actually give you a glimpse of the future, and are a must have tool in the successful trader's arsenal.In my Beginners Guide to Technical Analysis of Stock Charts here on Udemy, I covered fifty different technical indicators.  In this course, I teach the one indicator I use for all of my Buy and Sell Signals, and it's accuracy rate is about 80%. Two of the most important lessons included in this course are how to handle a false Buy Signal to keep losses to an absolute minimum, and when to lock in profits to maximize your gains. The trading strategy I teach in this course will provide you with a plan for entering and exiting trades with confidence. I look forward to helping you to become a successful Trader!Happy Trading! Tom  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2762_231c_20.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/swing-trading-the-stock-market/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Finance","Swing Trading"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":349,"isFree":false,"matches":["37722790-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab310-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b0a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb77-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37797a91-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37790564-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769468-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"simple-strategy-for-swing-trading-the-stock-market"}]}}

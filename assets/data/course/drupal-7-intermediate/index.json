Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.Vue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.To get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.If you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.You will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746764_7fa1_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Web Development","Vue JS"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b22b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js"},{"id":"377730a6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"29197","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.040Z","updated":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"How to Build a WordPress Form Using the Gravity Forms Plugin","headline":"Learn Exactly How to Unleash the Power of the Gravity Forms Plugin for WordPress with Our Advanced Video Training Course","description":"How to Build a Form? This is the exact question we get asked almost daily by our WordPress website clients. Our answer has always been “…get the Gravity Forms plugin.” Why? Before the Gravity Forms plugin existed we used a variety of freely available plugins for WordPress that allowed us to build web forms but we quickly reverted to creating our own custom web forms as soon as something more robust than a simple “Contact Us” form was needed. Then Gravity Forms was Released by Rocketgenius.When we first became aware of Gravity Forms back in 2010, our first thought was “why do we need to buy a plugin to build website forms when we already have free ones available, and if needed, we could simply code our own?” But that thought quickly faded as we took a closer look at the features and capabilities of the Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress. Not only does it provide a simple interface for building web forms, but it also provides incredible tools for creating very advanced web forms, all with a simple point and click interface. Why We Created This How to Build a Form Video Tutorial Course. Since purchasing the developer license of the Gravity Forms plugin and using it on our sites and those of our clients, we have have been nothing but impressed with both the ease of use and also the support that the folks at Rocketgenius provide. Not only that, but they are continually developing this plugin and adding new features requested by customers. However, although there is a lot of written documentation provided to purchasers of this plugin, we are visual learners and do much better when seeing something in action rather than reading through a “how to build a form” series of web pages. It wasn’t just us. Because we own the developer license and we use this on many clients sites, there were numerous times when site owners wanted to use the plugin to create an additional web form for their business and didn’t know how to use Gravity Forms. It was then that we started including “how to build a web form” videos for our clients, and it turned out that they were visual learners too. Seeing it in action allowed them to “just get it”. Maybe you’re a developer or site owner with the same set of problems? Then this course is for you.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/29197_f1a1_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/gravity-forms-wordpress-plugin-video-course/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Web Design","WordPress"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":46,"isFree":false,"matches":["3773d54b-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea521-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae37-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d543-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738722-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716440-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-build-a-word-press-form-using-the-gravity-forms-plugin"},{"id":"3773fc52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23477","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.816Z","updated":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn How To Build A Corporate Website Using Joomla! 2.5","headline":"THIS COURSE USES JOOMLA 2.5.

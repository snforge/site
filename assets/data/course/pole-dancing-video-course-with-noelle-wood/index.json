You do not need any previous knowledge of Photoshop, Design or Photography. We start by going through the essentials of Photoshop. A step-by-step guide on photoshop workspace, every single tool and its function(s). After we've established the essentials, we can now build on our foundation. In the next part of the photoshop course, we head into a basic Photoshop Portrait Retouching Course. From here the following lectures will deal with the more advanced photoshop techniques to really improve your Photoshop skills and the pace at which you work.I've added a bonus lecture towards the end of the course. That focuses on what & how when it comes to using a Wacom tablet in photoshop. I've also added a bonus lecture that focuses on the next steps.

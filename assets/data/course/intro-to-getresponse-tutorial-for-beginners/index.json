Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.Vue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.To get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.If you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.You will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746764_7fa1_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Web Development","Vue JS"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b22b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js"},{"id":"37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24823","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.886Z","updated":"2019-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners","headline":"Learn to program using the Java programming language","description":" Learn to program in the Java programming language.

Topics covered will include but not be limited to: Syntax and commands Creating variables Creating methods Working with files Exception handling Creating Classes Object-Oriented programming basics Basic Unit Testing Graphics and GUI programming In the end, this course is a stand-alone course, however it would be a huge aid to the online student who is taking a self-directed course, an individual who is trying to learn how to program, or even a high school student looking to get a head start on computer science material they might encounter in college. The material is organized in a start-to-finish fashion, building on knowledge with each section, so it is best to proceed through each section in order. Each section should amount to about a week worth of learning, lining up with most popular online course formats. Additionally, the course works hard to build practical knowledge that will help a student excel in their coursework, and also builds a strong foundation for a start to a career in programming for anyone looking to learn! As an added bonus, several useful programs are built throughout this course, and the end result of the course includes full source code for a working Sudoku game, amongst other programs, such as card game score calculators and basics physics formula calculation programs.

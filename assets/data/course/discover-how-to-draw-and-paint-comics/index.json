Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"37718b59-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19164","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.693Z","updated":"2014-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Graphic Design For Real Beginners","headline":"Sharpen your design skills and start designing like a pro instantly by learning these simple principles and techniques.","description":"Course Description: Want to explore a career as a graphic designer or improve your current design skills?

Starting with the lines of action and large abstract shapes, the course proceeds through small shapes, negative space, value, perspective, foreshortening, edge, line, details (face, hands and feet), and drapery on the figure. The final two lectures summarize the entire technique and give two examples using it to draw complete figures in under five minutes by Reilly Method Drawing. There are also five complete demonstrations using this technique done in 4- 7 minutes of figures drawn from life in a variety of positions. The driving principal behind this course is that the \"whole is more important than the parts\" which is the reason that I start with a gesture drawing and build on its structure until completion with anatomy and details. Also, I cover how to apply drapery to the figure using the same principles.

Especially since in germany a language test for physicians was introduced. From that time on the amount of books and courses in the internet increased a lot. But what makes a course good or bad? Many times the publishers offer you a huge amount of material, but sadly without specific structure related to the important german medical language exam. With this course I want to help you having success with the german language and passing the so called Fachsprachprüfung to be able to practice medicine in germany.The course gives you a comprehensive amount of material, specific for each chapter of the medical language test in germany. The videos show you how to communicate with patients, how to translate and intonate labvalues, and how to write doctor letters. The letters are adjusted and made by doctors, working in germany since years. Additional to that, I took from multiple clinics in germany the medical administration dokuments, adjusted and combined them to one big dokument. The complete course has audio. This way you can read, write and hear in the same time.I hope the course helps you with studying more efficiantly and more successfully.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746916_e231_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/german-for-doctors/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Language","German Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37738729-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37747182-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733901-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"deutsch-fuer-mediziner-german-for-doctors"},"related":[{"id":"377a8c06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2743804","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.151Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"MS-600 Microsoft 365 Certified Developer Associate Exam","headline":"Tests Help you to Achieve your Goals and pretest your Knowing about Microsoft managing MS-600 and Idea about Real Exam","description":"This is the right  IT Knowledge Center which Helps you to get your Certification about this examThis is very Crucial for Students who want to increase their knowledge about this certification.This is also important for instructor to Design these kind of Courses for Students to Measure their skills and Achieving the Certification.Try this test and learn something more new about this certification.Learn and Learn increase in your knowledge is beneficiary for students This Practice Test gives the idea relevant to the logical and difficult part of exam.If you want to looking for how the questions are asking in exams These kind of Q&A helped you in real exam Because this practice is give you the kind of questions and answers and how the examiner or Official exam was designed and method of asking from same topic with different statements to make it more difficult Welcome here you can enroll and check your self knowledge about this certificationImportant Questions and Answers with some ExplanationThese are the latest and updated Q&A about CertificationMS-600 Building Applications and Solutions with Microsoft 365 Core Services Exam Implement Microsoft Identity (20-25%)Build Apps with Microsoft Graph (20-25%)Extend and Customize SharePoint (20-25%)Extend Teams (15-20%)Extend Office (15-20%)","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743804_9329.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/ms-600-microsoft-365-certified-developer-associate-exam/","language":"en","tags":["IT & Software","IT Certification"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37795384-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37792c73-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64fe-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de58-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c0b-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789038-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c08-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"ms-600-microsoft-365-certified-developer-associate-exam"},{"id":"3777a5d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750778","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.042Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Advance Maths SSC,PSC,Railway,Vyapam & all competitive Exam.","headline":"Learn Advance Maths For competitive exam","description":"The course includes video explanations of solving complex Advance Maths problems in seconds.

Modern techniques developed by learning gurus include speed reading, visualization techniques, motivational strategies, visualization and many other methods which have been proven to work time and time again. My name is Paul Browning and I've been studying for most of my life. School, police promotion exams, a law degree and then several IT exams.

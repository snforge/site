Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"25311","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.887Z","updated":"2013-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Use Your Creative Mindpower To Transform Your Life","headline":"Learn proven techniques to make the most of your mindpower","description":"Can this course really transform your life? Yes!

Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.    Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don't know all the answers.    Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.    If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23972_35ee_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-speaking-smoothly-fluently-clearly-confidently/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Communication Skills"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":572,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738727-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"improve-communication-speak-smoothly-clearly-and-confidently"},{"id":"37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23926","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.883Z","updated":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Take Panic Out of Presenting with Simple Story Skills","headline":"Speaking can be hard, but it doesn't have to be.

You should see how my figures used to look.I almost gave up! Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked, I madequick leaps.

You read some figure drawingbooks? You even paid for personal art lessons? Why will my course be any different?  Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tellyou how important it is to master the stick figure before you even startdrawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most masterartists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level. They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learningprocess that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro.That is what this course does for you.

I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69dollars. What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me. But why? Why would I do that? Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, nooffice rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instantstreaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them.  “I had spent a lot ofmoney previously on books and classes however what i have learned from bothyour Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and ireally enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance ofpractice, practice, practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excitedand motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable, THANK YOU...”–OrlandoPiedrahita, CA Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 toproduce a new, flat-screen TV, and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m notgoing to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it. Why do my students believe I should charge $500?  Because you get 10 hours of video lessons.

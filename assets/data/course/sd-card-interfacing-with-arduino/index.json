Now, you can give and receive immediate and specific answers about romance, money, and career. You can predict the future using an item found in virtually every household--an ordinary deck of playing cards. Your Future Is In The Cards: Become a Fortune Teller in 7 Days demystifies the art of fortune-telling and delivers a step-by-step system of interpreting playing cards at a professional level. This crash course teaches you everything you need to know to begin a fortune telling with playing cards and giving accurate and detailed readings in just one week. The Method This course takes an analytical approach to cartomancy which means you’ll learn to read the cards using a logical, step-by-step process. Specific meanings are assigned based on card numbers, suits and even suit colors (red or black), creating a commonsense method that is easy to apply. Each card has a basic meaning but you will find new associations for the cards as you work with them. And, as you progress, your intuition will fill in the gaps. Through your readings, you will help yourself and your clients: · Perceive the present more clearly · Understand hidden influences · Uncover blocks and obstacles · Find solutions · See how the future may unfold What You Will Learn in this Course First, you get the basics, which means understanding the parts of a standard playing card deck, guidelines for cartomancers, and learning to shuffle and select cards. Next, you’ll learn what each card represents. Then, you’ll discover new techniques to gain more information from the cards to add important details to your readings in this playing card reading course. Masterfully, you will learn to pull precise details from the cards revealing physical descriptions (“Your future romantic partner has a dark complexion--perhaps of African American, Latin, East Indian, heritage. He’s stocky in build and he has facial hair”), and timing of events (“A job offer will be presented in the 2nd week of spring”). Take this course and become a fortune teller in 7 days!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/24351_a7c2_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/your-future-is-in-the-cards/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Religion & Spirituality","Clairvoyance"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":150,"isFree":false,"matches":["37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d38-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37766d52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b53-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"your-future-is-in-the-cards"},{"id":"3773ae36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"22643","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.815Z","updated":"2019-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Writing to Heal. Using journaling to transform your life","headline":"Create lasting change through journaling, writing, reflecting and creative writing exercises. Memoir preparation","description":"OverviewWriting to heal takes you on a journey that asks you  to first pick up your pen and write in a journal.  To then reflect on what you have written and  rewrite it with positive intention, so that you change your story.As you change the way in which you view life and  your story, your life will change.  Add  in the dimension of creative  writing exercises, through short stories, prose or poems, suddenly  you are on an adventure where you are in control of your destiny.  You can now decide what happens to the  characters and what the outcome of the tale might be.Let me hold your hand and guide you the process I use with my coaching clients.Course structureWe start by looking at what journaling is and in the first few modules get you started on your journaling journey and writing each  day.There are a number of different creative writing exercises for you to use as inspiration and kick-starts.After you have got used to your daily journaling, it  is then time to start reflecting and included are a number of reflection  exercises, which are designed to help you see where your unhelpful patterns of  behaviour are and to encourage you to change thought patterns, habits, beliefs  and perceptions.Both journaling and reflecting are immensely healing  activities in themselves. I have added in creative life writing as I have  witnessed both my clients and myself getting huge benefits from melding fact  with fiction to come up with some factional stories, which put us back in the  driving seat of our lives.How long will it take?It takes as long as you would like. How you work through the material  should be in a way that suits you. You are encouraged to journal for 30 days to create a good habit.  The exercises are designed to get you thinking and for you to a) follow in a linear fashion or b)  randomly try things.Why take this course?This course is for anyone who feels 'stuck' and  would like to try a novel approach to changing their life and starting to heal.  Writing is cathartic and when you  add in reflection and creative life writing the opportunities for change and  healing open up.What else?Many people who use journalling have discovered that  they also have a book inside of them.   You may not want to publish your book, however, this course will lead  you from journaling into creative life writing and give you the confidence to  write a book if you so choose.If you can journal you can write, if you can write  short stories you can write a book.                                                                So start learning these highly creative writing exercises  to reveal your full potential. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/22643_564d_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-to-heal/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Journaling"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":69,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c5b34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea522-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d3a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"writing-to-heal-using-journaling-to-transform-your-life"},{"id":"3772c3d5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"21109","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.812Z","updated":"2013-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn Step-by-Step How to Build a Smart Home System","headline":"Discover how to use your Smartphone or Tablet to Control your Home Lighting, Thermostats, IP cameras, Music & Security.","description":"This Step-by-Step Home Automation DIY video program shows you everything from A to Z on how to create your Home Automation system, which will reduce energy Consumption, create a comfortable family living environment & protect your home against Intruders.

The exercises at the end of each video module helped me to take action every week. Gerard was really helpful and provided encouragement over the 8 week period.” Bogdan Dragoi, Romania “When I started the 8 week challenge last March, I knew very little about where to start and how to go about using my iPhone to view IP camera’s, remotely changing temperature levels and playing music in ever room of our home. After the 8 weeks with Gerard, I added all of these systems to my smartphone and lots more.

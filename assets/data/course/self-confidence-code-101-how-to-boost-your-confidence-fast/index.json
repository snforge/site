Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.    Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don't know all the answers.    Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.    If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23972_35ee_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-speaking-smoothly-fluently-clearly-confidently/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Communication Skills"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":572,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738727-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"improve-communication-speak-smoothly-clearly-and-confidently"},{"id":"3773d549-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"22858","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.816Z","updated":"2019-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Thawing the Inner Family of Self","headline":"Meet Your Inner Family of Self, Heal the Past, Increase Self Esteem and Enrich Your Relationships with Others!","description":" In the Thawing Your Inner Family of Self program I've blended the most useful and effective techniques I have learned in my almost 30 years of clinical experience.

It is designed to teach other counselors and coaches these very powerful and effective techniques for helping their clients too. The program is also a great compliment to any helping process by providing structure and tools for use with clients. I combined the classics with some of the newest, most powerful personal transformation technologies available today to create this interactive process for Overcoming Childhood Trauma, personal healing and development. These include Gestalt psychology, Ego-State therapy, Inner Family Systems Therapy, Precision Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Transactional Analysis, Inner Child work, Parts Integration, Hypnosis, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Schema Therapy, and many other models.

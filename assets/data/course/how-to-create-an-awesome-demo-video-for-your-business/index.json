Explainer videos are an easy and dynamic way of letting folks know about your products or services and they can mean the difference between a lookie-loo and actual sales. Unfortunately, many companies let the high costs of professional videos turn them off to the real power of this marketing medium. Some folks even create low quality videos in-house. As dynamic and powerful as videos can be, bad videos can be just as persuasive... in a totally negative way - giving potential customers a bad impressive of your company. Rather than adding poor quality videos to your site, you're probably better off not adding videos at all. Now your company can stand out from the crowd and you don't need to spend $10K in order to have a professional video produced for your site. Are you ready for this? You can start enjoying the benefits of learning how to make your own, professional quality videos now with the help of an awesome video series that teaches you everything you need to know.

The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"3776e285-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27987","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.945Z","updated":"2013-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Video Editing Workshop Complete Beginners Course-Sony Vegas","headline":"Students, teens, housemoms, VA, salesmen, secretaries, marketers, or any newbie - start making professional videos now!","description":"IMAGINE IF YOU CAN….

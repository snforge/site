The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund.

Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world.

Daily actions help you get clarity and stay focused.","description":"**** all new case study material added 2016 *** Starting a business seems like a great idea.... But it can soon become overwhelming. So many requirements, regulations. And that's even without assessing whether we have a marketable idea and whether it will create the kind of success we really want. From idea to implementation This course is designed to cut through all of that and to take you on a thirty day journey from inspiration to income. I want to take your desire and your passion and show you how to turn it into practical actions that allow you to come up with profitable business ideas and your passion and to create income before the month is over. Accessible training in bite sized chunks Day by day, step-by step, this course will strip away much of the overwhelm you may feel as a new entrepreneur. It will take you on a journey from coming up with profitable business ideas, discovering where your talents lie, to testing and packaging what you are going to sell, and to show you how to actually make money now. You need to check out your idea against these three criteria There are so many books and courses for new businesses and coming up with profitable business ideas. Books that tell you about business plans and accounts. But before you start to pull together these processes, you need to know that you have: 1. Profitable business ideas. 2. A business model that is a fit for the life and income you want to create. 3. A product or service that people want to buy! Shortcut your success I work with clients who sometimes find years later that their business might be successful financially but they want to get out and so something they love. Or they have a great idea but they just can't make money with it. Or they have a business that runs their life, rather than a business that gives them the life they want. I don't want this for you. I created this course so that you could shortcut this journey. Yes you will need the right legal and financial framework. But you must also build your business on a foundation that will give you the fulfillment, the life and the income you want. Check you are on the right track right from the start This course shows you how to understand and rigorously test your profitable business ideas so that you know you are on the right track before you start (or to help you get re-oriented when you've hit a roadblock!). This is for you if... This course is for you if you want to start a business doing what you love. If you want to feel fulfilled by what you do. And you want to create a lifestyle that works for you. This course is for you if you've already started a business but you're feeling as if you didn't take the right path. Or if you know that you've found your passion but you're struggling to turn it into income. Or if you simply want to know how to do the things that will move you forward day by day. Because it's the staying in action that gets results for you. Get Momentum: Start A Business You Love combines motivation with real, practical, actionable strategies. Anyone who is running a service business or a is a solo-preneur will find it especially valuable - creatives, coaches, consultants, designers, healers... This is designed for you. We'll cover: ● How to build a business from your strengths - because this will make you more successful ● Why people buy what you're selling and why are will buy from you ● How to do the 'five minute money check-in' (do this before you make important decisions!) ● How to create income before the course is over ● Why knowing your revenue model will help you know how to grow your business ● Measuring success an easy way to monitor the numbers you need to pay attention to ● How to take one step at a time to achieve your ambitions (hint: I tell my clients I can get rid of 80%% of the things on their to-do list and this technique will help you do that too) ● Identify and know how you are going to achieve your money goal (with downloadable spreadsheet) ● Where to begin delegating even if you think you can't afford it yet ● Three very simple questions that will help you stay on track when the course is over Practical actions And the best part is that this course isn't just about learning. It's about practical actions. Every day you will take an action step that is relevant and specific to you and your profitable business ideas. This is what will take you from idea to income - this is what separates those who succeed from those who stay stuck - it's about the doing not just the learning...

The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"3775f825-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"26818","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.940Z","updated":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Startup PR: Getting Press on a Tight Budget","headline":"Tech journalist Erica Swallow shares her public relation strategies for getting press for your startup.","description":"Join tech journalist Erica Swallow for an overview of public relations strategies to interact with journalists and ultimately gain press for your startup.

LATEST: Course Updated Again for September 2015Learn EXACTLY what I've taught international brands like McDonald's and evian... in only 2 hours!Gain the skills major brands have paid hundreds of thousands for. Quickly and easily.Over 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.Have you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"I've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.It has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.I make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.When I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.I know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.Every single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.Nothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics. And you pay NOTHING EXTRA for this ongoing content.Plus, Udemy has a 30 day guarantee. And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.What this is course IS NOT:I do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.I will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.I won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.But, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.Every minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...Enroll now!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25581_4b8c_14.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/branding-public-relations-social-media-cc/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Business Branding"],"rating":3.5,"reviews":34,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-master-branding-public-relations-and-social-media"},{"id":"3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17844","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.602Z","updated":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"From Startup to Millions Before 30","headline":"Previously sold as \"A Young Entrepreneur's Guide to Starting and Growing a Business\"","description":"From the producers of over one thousand business building programs and creators of entrepreneurial educational videos with organizations such as Inc.

Learn why hundreds of companies, from financial services companies like Wealthfront to social companies like IMVU to large corporations such as Intuit, are using this revolutionary technique. But what is Lean Startup, or more importantly, how do I implement Lean principles into my own company? Well, to answer that question, we've brought in the Godfather of Lean Startup himself, Eric Ries. Not only has he written the book on \"The Lean Startup,\" but he has also now created THE course on Lean Startup. Eric brought in all of the leaders in the movement to talk to you about what lean startup is and how to implement it into your company. This course is the real deal - it's the most content you'll ever get on the Lean Startup in one place. More importantly, it is curated - Eric has personally taken the most important aspects of Lean Startup and condensed it into a single course. And then he added a few dozen case studies of it by including bonus material from the definitive conferences on the subject.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8467_e90b_8.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Lean Startup"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":369,"isFree":false,"matches":["376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c0d13-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f825-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-lean-startup"}]}}

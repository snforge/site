No prior knowledge of C++ is assumed. The course is based on the excellent textbook Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. Like the textbook, the course quickly dives into problem solving and making use of the C++ standard library, including strings, vectors, and lists. The emphasis is on teaching you the parts of C++ that you will most likely need in your day-to-day programming. This course is Part 1 of a planned two-part sequence. Part 1 covers the first seven chapters of Accelerated C++, in particular, Chapters 0 through 6. The course consists of six videos of 50-60 minutes each. Part 2 of the course, forthcoming, will cover the second half of Accelerated C++, including how to write your own classes and generic functions.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/17503_7fa8_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-short-and-sweet/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C++"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":1391,"isFree":true,"matches":["376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"c-short-and-sweet-part-1"},"related":[{"id":"37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2749466","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.041Z","updated":null,"title":"x86 Assembly Language Programming Masters Course","headline":"Learn Assembly From A Decade Of Experience","description":"This course is intended to teach you x86 assembly programming. This course teaches you how processors work and how machine code is possible. We start the course using an emulator for the legacy Intel 8086 processor.Since we start the course with an emulator it allows me to pause the machine at any moment in time and show you exactly what is going on.After you learn all about the legacy 8086 processor and how to program assembly for it we then move to the modern processors of today and start writing assembly for those. You are taught how to write 32 bit programs for Windows machine's and most importantly how to communicate with C programs using assembly language.This course recommends that you have some prior experience in the C programming language or at the very least some programming experience in another language. The reason for this is because part two of the course when I teach modern assembly I reference the C programming language quite a lot since we write assembly that can talk with C.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749466_d775_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Assembly Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d39-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course"},{"id":"37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24823","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.886Z","updated":"2019-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners","headline":"Learn to program using the Java programming language","description":" Learn to program in the Java programming language.

Step-by-step it explains how to write C# code to develop Windows applications using either the free Visual Studio Community Edition or a commercial edition of Microsoft Visual Studio (it even explains how to write C# programs using free tools for OS X). This is the completely revised and updated second version of this course.  C# is one of the most widely used an important of all modern programming languages. If you need to learn C# quickly and painlessly, this is the perfect course. You will begin by learning the core features of programming – variables, constants, functions and data types. You will move on rapidly to learn about Object Orientation and the more advanced features of C# and the .NET framework such as file-handling, data-streaming, dealing with exceptions (errors) and overriding methods. Even if you start out as a complete beginner, by the end of this course you will have built a really solid foundation of programming knowledge and skills. All the source code of sample projects is provided ready for you to download, run and modify. The course also includes an eBook that provides even more information on the topics being discussed. And there are also interactive quizzes to test your understanding of each major topic. The course instructor, Huw Collingbourne, is Director of Technology with SapphireSteel Software, a company that specialises in Visual Studio development tools (written in C#) for professional programmers. Learn C# Programming (in ten easy steps) is the fastest and simplest way to help you make the move from coding novice to professional programmer. The first version of this course was launched in 2012. The current version has been completely re-made and expanded with numerous new lessons.

Topics covered will include but not be limited to: Syntax and commands Creating variables Creating methods Working with files Exception handling Creating Classes Object-Oriented programming basics Basic Unit Testing Graphics and GUI programming In the end, this course is a stand-alone course, however it would be a huge aid to the online student who is taking a self-directed course, an individual who is trying to learn how to program, or even a high school student looking to get a head start on computer science material they might encounter in college. The material is organized in a start-to-finish fashion, building on knowledge with each section, so it is best to proceed through each section in order. Each section should amount to about a week worth of learning, lining up with most popular online course formats. Additionally, the course works hard to build practical knowledge that will help a student excel in their coursework, and also builds a strong foundation for a start to a career in programming for anyone looking to learn! As an added bonus, several useful programs are built throughout this course, and the end result of the course includes full source code for a working Sudoku game, amongst other programs, such as card game score calculators and basics physics formula calculation programs.

Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, you’ll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, you’ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, you’ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

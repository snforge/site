I know how you feel but I found out how to land your dream job.","description":"\" To anyone who wants to enjoy a career in IT\" My name is Paul Browning and I worked as a police officer in the UK from 1988 to 2000. While I enjoyed the job immensely I felt I wanted to take on a new challenge, I already had an interest in computers. I had attended an course on PC assembly and learned a little bit about computer networking. I started to study for some Microsoft exams and began to apply for jobs in the IT industry. I landed a helpdesk job but as you can imagine, I quickly became bored doing password resets. I studied hard and passed some more exams and then got a role doing network support for Cisco systems in the UK. I later left to start my own IT company offering training and consulting services to companies both in the UK and internationally. I sold the company in 2008 and now run an online Cisco training company. During the time I trained students I helped many hundreds of them get their break into a career in IT. I watched them move from helpdesk roles into networking and often into freelance consulting contracts or even their own companies. I’ve also worked with hundreds of IT managers who have shared with me the things they look for when looking to hire IT staff for their companies. I’ve even been through the process myself when I was looking to get out of the police force. I see people making the same mistakes time and time again when they are trying to get a job in IT: Sending resumes out and hoping for the bestWaiting for jobs to appear online before applyingSending generic resumes which will never be readFailing to prepare properly for technical interviewsNot presenting themselves professionally to companiesand many more common mistakes Break Into IT has been devised with people like you in mind. It is a one stop training resource to help you plan, prepare and execute your plan to get you from where you are now to where you want to be. Here are just a few of the things you will learn: How to find the best jobs before they appear onlineHow to tap into vast networks of people willing to help youThe secrets to getting your resume readHow to get called for interviewsHow to ace technical interviewsStanding out from the crowdHow to bridge the lack of experience problemHow to negotiate your salary and benefitsHow to get advancement once you get inand much more These tips will help you if you want to apply for any IT roles including: Networking\nDesktop support\nHelpdesk\nProgramming\nWeb design\nProject management and support Most people are doing it all wrong and never get called for interviews. They wonder why but because they don't know how the system works they will be forever in the dark. These principles have been used my thousands of my students to break into IT.

This course covers all the basics of green screening and it even goes in depth to cover a range of topics to help beginners perfect their videos. In this green screen tutorial course, you will learn the exact steps to take in order to set up your green screen, lighting, camera and tripod, including the positioning of everything. You will learn how to turn your laptop into a teleprompter and how to have a great presence on camera. Once you have setup everything, we'll go over the basics of shooting our first video, and then we will actually shoot a video on the green screen. Shooting green screen video isn't all that hard once you get the hang of it, so that is why this course doesn't just stop there. A large portion of this course focuses on taking the actual video that we shot and editing it in iMovie. We'll go over removing the green screen background, making your own custom backgrounds, adding in pictures and b-roll, editing audio and much more. To wrap the course up, we'll go over tips/tricks and do's/don'ts that I have personally picked up or learned from trial and error from doing over 700 green screen videos.

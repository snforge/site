Lack of EDA knowledge can expose you to the great risk of drawing incorrect, and potentially harmful, conclusions from your data analysis.In this course, you will learn how EDA helps you draw conclusions to make better sense of your data and implement correct techniques. We'll begin with a brief introduction to EDA, its importance, and advantages over BI tools. Using R libraries like dplyr and ggplot2, we will generate insights and formulate relevant questions for investigation and communicate the results effectively using visualizations. You will learn how to spot missing data and errors, validate assumptions, and identify the patterns for understanding the problem. Based on this, you’ll be able to select a correct ML model to use for your data.By the end of the course, you will be able to quickly get know and interpret various kinds of data sets you will be presented with, and easily understand how to handle and work with them in order to make them ready for further modeling activities.Please note that basic knowledge of R and R Studio, together with some knowledge of descriptive statistics, are key to getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorAndrea Cirillo is currently working as Internal Auditor at Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group, after gaining financial and external audit experience at Deloitte Touche & Tohmatsu and internal Audit experience at FNM, an Italian listed company.

These powerful techniques are often used in applied machine learning to achieve the best overall performance.In this unique course, after installing the necessary tools you will jump straight into the bagging method so as to get the best results from algorithms that are highly sensitive to specific data—for example, algorithms based on decision trees. Next, you will discover another powerful and popular class of ensemble methods called boosting. Here you'll achieve maximal algorithm performance by training a sequence of models, where each given model improves the results of the previous one. You will then explore a much simpler technique called voting, where results from multiple models are achieved using simple statistics such as the mean average. You will also work hands-on with algorithms such as stacking and XGBoost to improve performance.By the end of this course, you will know how to use a variety of ensemble algorithms in the real world to boost your machine learning models.Please note that a working knowledge of Python 3; the ability to run simple commands in Shell (Terminal); and also some basic machine learning experience are core prerequisites for taking and getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and programmed professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share this with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups, he was involved in. He failed miserably then. He then discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning, which he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to the “Keep it simple” mantra. He is the author of multiple bestselling video courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Real-World Deep Learning Python Projects and AI in Finance.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742004_65b9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769462-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python"},{"id":"3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750884","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.046Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Linear Regression : Prerequisites for Deep Learning","headline":"Linear Regression basic concepts in python with hand's on project","description":"In this basic course you are going to learn:Data analytics data analytics introTypes of analyticsAnalytical approachWhat is machine learning and Reinforcement learningSupervised Learning & Unsupervised learning Covariance and Correlation in DataTypes of the algorithm in supervised learning=v6Regression tableCovariance and Correlation in DataUnivariate AnalysisMultivariate AnalysisAssumptions of LinearityLimitations of RegressionCase Study For Linear Regression Performance Analysis","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2750884_c67f.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-regression/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Deep Learning"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3779a1a9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716447-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"linear-regression-prerequisites-for-deep-learning"},{"id":"3777a5d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750076","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.042Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Data Analytics - Preguntas de apoyo con selección múltiple","headline":"Incluye documentación para preparar la certificación: Data Analytics Certified Associate (DACA)","description":"Data Analytics - Material de estudio y preguntas de apoyo con selección múltipleEl Data Analytics Certified Associate - DACA evalúa sus conocimientos y diversos conjuntos de habilidades con respecto a los procesos de diagnóstico, captura, limpieza de datos, análisis, documentación, explotación y conjuntos de datos para los informes.

Understanding where to look, what to look for, and what to do with what you see will change everything you do in your business...Best part: You can check everything out for FREE if you choose!If you're looking for an “insider\" shortcut guide to creating success online that will supercharge your business, your wealth, and give you your life back, then you've gotta read every word on this page.Because what you're about to learn will bring you whatever you desire in life.… Buckets of money…… the awe and respect of people who now doubt you…… time to spend with your family and friends…… a new life without financial worry or indecision.You can get it with …Google Analytics Mastery eCourse!...and the reason why...To be successful in business and in life you must have laser focus, and consistent action towards what's working. The secret is to know what's working, and not be distracted one bit by all the blinking new channels, tools, and sites that beg for your attention.Most people in business can get some traffic to their website, typically spend some time on Facebook or Twitter or any of the many social media sites available to them, and may do some basic search engine optimization. But when it comes to being “successful online\", most don't have the time or direction to know where and what to focus on. So we try to do it all – “jack of all trades, master of none\"Look. Everyone has access to Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, blah blah blah. The fact is your customers are really there too. They're searching on Google, they're hanging out on Facebook. So why then do most businesses just spin their wheels and flounder around in search of success?Think of it this way – anyone can own a set of golf clubs. Typically there's an assortment of 10 or more clubs in the bag – and you can whack the little dimpled thing with any one of those clubs.But to play golf well…to be a master of the game and make the ball go exactly where you want it to go…then you need to know what clubs to use and when. You need to know when the #7 club will put you within inches of your goal where #8 or 9 will leave you in the rough, lost in the sea of all the other golfers.… you need the inside secrets you will not discover casually on your own.It's the same with analysis.The advanced, mega powerful secrets do not appear to you magically, just because now you're in the position of having to sell something. You need a guide.Google Analytics Mastery is that guide.It guides you by the hand and leads you through the hell of understanding Google Analytics…… past the explosion of reports staring back at you on your screen…… past the smoking wreckage of failed business and ruined dreams……and directly to action based steps that will produce ethical wealth and heavenly happiness that will bring you to tears.This is the “insider\" course we wish was around when we were starting out online.  Learning even one or two of these secrets would have short-cut our own success by… oh… five… maybe ten years.  Probably more.Included in this best-selling eCourse Now Available On Udemy are secrets most businesses never discover… such as:How to quickly and properly set-up Google Analytics to reap the rewards of accurate dataThe magic of tracking goals – and why you can't afford not to have this functioningHow to make advertising dollars go further with connecting cost per click results to your web analyticsVery simple strategy to know where to focus on search engine optimization – what key phrases are worthwhile and which ones are a waste of your timeWhy your current data might be wrong, and a quick simple fix to solve itHow to navigate this endless realm of reports and crush the overwhelm – (Looking right over our shoulder we guide you on our screen)How to analyze in lightning speed by looking only at the data you need to seeWhy potential customers immediately bolt for the exit on your web site – and you didn't even realize you had a problem!How to look at the information visually if you're not a numbers person – or just hate the endless numbersThe insanely effective secret of marketers and what they're looking atHow to explode your offline marketing results through measuring strategies – yes even newspaper advertising can be trackedWhat is really driving sales or leads to your business, and whats just wasting your timeHow to spy on your prospects and see whats working with them on your siteHow some marketing affects other marketing and whether it turns to moneyHow to discover why your web sites failing within minutes of scanning the dataHow to measure a social media strategy immediately – we're talking the second you hit enter on that tweet or Facebook update Why certain pages on your web site are killing your businessWhat content on your web site you shouldn't touch – or risk back-tracking months or even years of progressWhat the search engines really think your business is about and how to fix itAnd… the mystery behind online success, how some marketers seem to do everything right, and how you can apply this priceless observations to your business…and this is just the beginning. Once you have the basics down, taking actionable, measurable steps towards marketing improvement is easy.That's just a small sample of what you'll find in this members only eCourse. There is over 5 hours of video training, watching our screens as we guide you to becoming an analytics master. And give you the roadmap you need to start creating your own ridiculously successful marketing campaigns.  The trainings are on average 10 minutes in length. This is a powerful way to learn… watch the video, then apply the learning to your own business! Progress at your own pace or cram all weekend long and implement everything. Whichever works best for you.In addition, there is over 3 hours of special video case studies for online business management included... This is where the rubber hits the road and we apply all you've learned to real businesses, real data, real lives!Plus (and probably more critical than any other part of the course) in addition to the all that you get in the members area training – you also receive Lifetime Membership to our monthly members only advanced trainings! Every month we continue to guide you by way of live webinars, special reports, or recorded case studies for members only to advance your learning and your results.When you think about it, this really isn't a training course you buy, rather an investment into your businesses foundation – membership that will continue to give back for years to come. In fact the course continues to evolve every month as our members grow from the advanced members only trainings. And because this isn't just what we teach, but what we do – if you get stuck, we're just a comment or email away as our Analytics team monitors the members area conversation.I don't care if you've never looked at a single page of web analytics in your life. Or if you're a veteran just trying to get further ahead with your results. Or if you've tried every shiny object that's come along and failed.None of that matters.The ONLY thing that matters…is your desire to get started. To start measuring ALL YOUR efforts and with laser focus, start taking the right actionable steps that bring in sales and new customers in a flood, fast and furious.This isn't brain surgery. You might be able to figure it all out on your own. Eventually.Or you can take advantage of the 10+ years of bumps, successes and failures figuring out how to maximize our results, and reduce effort. We've certainly made our mistakes trying to figure all this out, where to focus, what was really working, and what was completely a waste of our time. Lost staring at computer screens for hours, days even weeks – not realizing the time spent was all in vain.There is absolutely no sane reason why you should want to waste years of your own life attempting to cover this same ground.This is the course we would have killed to own when we started out.

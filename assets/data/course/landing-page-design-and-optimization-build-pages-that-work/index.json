WIN 'EM OVER WITH WEB VIDEO PART 2: Stand Out and Move Up in Search Engine Results with Effective Web Video (HOW TO PREVENT A RAIN OUT ON YOUR FIELD OF DREAMS WITH WEB VIDEO):  This is a beginner-friendly course for busy professionals who want to learn how to create effective web video AND boost their search engine optimization efforts. Students will learn the basics of web video production and search engine optimization. This course provides video, screen records, and sample files for busy professionals who want the most essential information presented to them in a manner that can be quickly and easily digested and applied in under a half day (4 hours). After successful completion, students will learn video production and SEO for Video basics. The course instructor is Kamala Appel, aka \"the key\" in KEA Productions. She has produced numerous documentary-style web videos for small business owners and non-profit organizations since 2002. Ms. Appel worked in Hollywood in licensing at Universal Studios and Business Affairs at International Creative Management (ICM) and in programming at the Sundance Film Festival. She is a graduate of Yale University and where earned a BA in American Studies with a concentration in Film Studies and USC's School of Cinema-Television, now Cinematic Arts, where she earned her Master's degree.  She is also a certified SEO Practitioner. \"What I love most about producing videos for small business owners and nonprofits is the opportunity to work with passionate professionals who are experts in their field. I feel very fortunate to be able to use my skills as a visual storyteller to help others. Unfortunately, I am not able to help every worthy business owner out there because not everyone can afford to hire a professional like myself to produce a video for them.  That is why I decided to develop a course that could empower more businesses, start ups, and nonprofits compete and share their passion with the world.\" Ms. Appel has been a faculty member at a number of accredited offline colleges throughout the State of California.  As an experienced film and multimedia instructor, she takes into consideration the three main learning styles: aural (listening- you can listen to the modules), visual (you can watch the videos with images that will hopefully stay with you), and kinetic (movement- you can exercise your kinetic learning style by taking notes and doing the quizzes). In addition to the modules or short training videos, there are samples and screen recordings * (Including FinalCut Pro and After FX demos) for all three stages: pre-production or planning, production or shooting, and post-production or editing; so that you can follow along throughout the process. To further your learning experience, there is an interactive coaching program that complements the e-learning course and supplementary materials. During the coaching calls we will delve more deeply into the materials with scenarios and go over the quizzes. Questions can be answered live and students can participate in interviews with other industry experts. As someone who has purchased this Web Video Production course, you get your first month's membership for free. So if you are a busy professional and you want to be able to have access to the information you need to take your business or organization to the next level with web video and SEO for video basics, then this is the course for you. If you want to positively persuade your target audience, your bottom line, and boost your SEO efforts, then again, this course is for you. Again, this is an accelerated course so that you can get through the materials in a manageable way while trying to stay sane throughout your busy life. Please note: The first several video modules are free to allow you to preview the style. These opening videos give students a chance to learn some history and the general philosophy that will influence the core content. The \"meat\" of the course is only available to paid subscribers who want to invest further in their online marketing efforts.

It's SEO easy!In this course, I show you how I get 1,000 visitors a day - that's a third of a million people a year. And it's not the mythical 'hits' that some people boast about. These are real live humans.AND IF YOU ARE A WEB DESIGNER, APPLICATION DEVELOPER, FREELANCER, THIS COULDN'T BE MORE APPROPRIATE. YOU ARE SELLING TO EXACTLY THE SAME AUDIENCE I SELL TO. And I did all the search engine optimization myself. I don't pretend to be an SEO guru. In fact, I hate technology, but I realized some time ago that your rankings in Google searches are too valuable to entrust to others. There's no need to spend a fortune with SEO companies when you can achieve astounding results yourself - without any technical expertise. After all, no-one knows your business like you do, and no one can be as highly motivated.Does it work?These are the results of some of my key phrase Google rankings (PS I am a copywriter)IT Copywriter - position number one out of over 13 million competing sitesBrochure Copywriter - top position out of 375,000 competing sitesWhite Paper Copywriter - number one out of 233,000 sitesLogistics Copywriter - top out of half a million siteCopy and PasteIn this search engine optimization training course, there's no sales hype. I just lift the kimono and show you exactly what I did to my own site – and you can do exactly the same to your site – just 'copy and paste'. And, yes, it does take into account the latest changes that Google has made to its ranking algorithm.A jargon-free zoneWe start very gently, taking a bite at a time. In the entire course there are just six hard-core jargon words (I couldn't avoid those). They are search engine optimization basics, so they are easy to understand. The rest is pure layman's language. Each video introduces a new concept and is followed by a downloadable pdf, so you have a hard copy and can add notes of your own.Oh – and I am very accessible. Any queries, or anything not clear, just email me.I am here to help.WARNING: If you are already proficient at SEO, this course is NOT for you. It's not for 'techies', so you will be disappointed and frustrated. It is intended for people like me, too occupied running my business to want to get down to the minutia. I just want top ratings – and that's what I get.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/12196_c290_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/search-engine-optimization-made-easy/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","SEO"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":531,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376a5f60-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376fdda0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"seo-beginners-how-i-get-1-000-visitors-a-day-with-seo"},{"id":"376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"11331","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.177Z","updated":"2017-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"SEO Training Course by Moz","headline":"Learn SEO tips and tricks in this SEO training course from Moz","description":" SEO is the active practice of optimizing a web site by improving internal and external aspects in order to increase the traffic the site receives from search engines.

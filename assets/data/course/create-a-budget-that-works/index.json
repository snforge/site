Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"25311","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.887Z","updated":"2013-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Use Your Creative Mindpower To Transform Your Life","headline":"Learn proven techniques to make the most of your mindpower","description":"Can this course really transform your life? Yes!

If you want to learn internet marketing, if you're looking to build a business that has a real consistent, dependable income but have been struggling to make money online so far, then YES you're in the right place... You may or may not like everything you read on this page and some of it may sting a little, but I've never been ones to tell the truth with a sugar coating... Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... And here it is, it's the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) But why is that? Surely if everyone's buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest '1 click to riches' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn't they? Why are there so many people failing? Think about it like this... Most marketers aren't lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? Well here's the cold, hard truth: Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap 'systems' that don't work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass 'gurus' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it's not your fault. It's simply the nature of the industry. But look - If you've found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no \"magic bullet\". You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works! And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - And that's why I'm so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you'll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it's all geared up to you finally getting the results you've always wanted FAST!

Explainer videos are an easy and dynamic way of letting folks know about your products or services and they can mean the difference between a lookie-loo and actual sales.

As dynamic and powerful as videos can be, bad videos can be just as persuasive... in a totally negative way - giving potential customers a bad impressive of your company. Rather than adding poor quality videos to your site, you're probably better off not adding videos at all. Now your company can stand out from the crowd and you don't need to spend $10K in order to have a professional video produced for your site. Are you ready for this? You can start enjoying the benefits of learning how to make your own, professional quality videos now with the help of an awesome video series that teaches you everything you need to know.

With SketchUp Pro, you have the ultimate tool for creating just that; LayOut. LayOut is the companion program that comes with SketchUp Pro. It takes your 3D model and creates 2D snapshots of your model and places them onto \"pages\" so you can add dimensions, annotations, and other information in order to create a complete set of construction documents. This course gives you a complete introduction to LayOut, teaching you all the basics you need to know in order to create a presentation of your model. In addition, you'll learn how to prepare your SketchUp model for LayOut. Have complete control over the look of you LayOut viewports by properly organizing your SketchUp model and creating scenes. After learning how to create a LayOut document, you'll also learn advanced techniques in SketchUp for creating section cuts, hatch patterns, and poche effects. This video course includes the SketchUp to LayOut PDF ebook which has all of the lessons from this video course, and other valuable tutorials which you can follow. You'll also get the CAD hatch material library and style library so you can apply traditional hatch patterns to your model. By the end of this course, you'll have a complete understanding of how to create a SketchUp model specifically for LayOut, as well as how to create a full set of construction documents inside LayOut.

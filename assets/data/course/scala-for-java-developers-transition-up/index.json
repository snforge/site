Spring Boot 2.x, a feature-rich platform built from the Spring 5.x framework, is created by to help developers solve their complex problems with fewer configurations but with strong dependency management features.In this course, you will learn how to create various modules in a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) such as employee timesheets, leave management, and profiling. You will use Spring Boot 2.x to create your HRIS app while integrating Spring Web MVC, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data, RESTful web services, and clients. Above all, you'll use the latest version of Spring Security—5.0—to secure your apps and OAuth 2.x to implement an OpenID connection. You'll apply reactive programming with its Spring Web Flux and Project Reactor features. Finally, you will deploy your apps and services using some popular cloud and container platforms such as Spring Cloud Foundry, Docker, and AWS.By the end of the course, you will be confident in implementing the core features of Spring Boot 2.x to create scalable, optimal, and robust enterprise web applications.About the AuthorSherwin John Calleja Tragura started his career as a Java developer by focusing on the Documentum and Alfresco document management systems. His first exposure to mobile applications started in 2010 when he first installed and used the Alfresco mobile application, which featured core document content services.He is currently a technical corporate trainer and a subject matter expert on Java, JEE, and Spring application development. He is a certified EMC Documentum and OCP Java 7 Associate. He authored the following Packt books—Spring MVC Blueprints and Spring 5 Cookbook and also a Packt video course: Jakarta EE 8 Recipes. Before that, he was a technical editor for Alfresco Share, Alfresco 3 Records Management, Mastering Hibernate, and Delphi Cookbook.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743574_0ca9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-java-web-applications-with-spring-boot-2x/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Spring Boot"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37744a76-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d39-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d35-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd066-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef18-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"modern-java-web-applications-with-spring-boot-2-x"},{"id":"37786922-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2745650","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.047Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Lambda with Functional Programming in Java8","headline":"Lambda expression with Functional Programming Example","description":"This Course basically designed for the people who has knowledge in prior knowledge about java.We will Cover the Followings in this course , LambdasStreamsParallel StreamsOptional New Interface Concepts Here the Sub Topics we are going to cover in this tutorial , 01 About the Course02 Why Java8 03 Java7 vs Java8 Example Part 104 Java7 vs Java8 Example Part 205 What is lambda06 Implement Runnable Using Lambda Expression07 Implement Comparator Using Lambda Expression08 How to install Java Decompiler in Eclipse09 Introduction to Functional Interfaces10 Consumer Interface Part-111 Consumer Interface Part-212 Consumer Interface Part-313 BiConsumer Interface Part 114 BiConsumer Interface Part 215 Predicate Interface Part 116 Predicate Interface Part 217 Predicate Interface Part 318 Predicate Interface Part 419 Function Interface Part 120 Function Interface Part 221 Function Interface Part 322 Unary and Binary Functional Interface23 Supplier Functional Interface24 Method Reference 25 Method Reference and Constructor Reference26 Lambda Local Variable27 Streams Introduction27 Streams Introduction 128 Streams Example Part 129 Streams Example Part 230 Streams Example Part 331 Streams Map Example Part 132 Streams Map Example Part 233 Streams FlatMap Example Part 134 Streams FlatMap Example Part 235 Streams FlatMap Example Part 336 Streams FlatMap Example Part 437 Streams Filter Example38 Streams Reduce Example Part 139 Streams Reduce Example Part 240 Streams Filter Map Reduce Example41 Streams MinBy, MaxBy Example42 Streams Limit Skip Example43 Streams AllMatch, AnyMatchExample44 Streams FindAny , FindFirst Example45 Streams Factory Method Example46 Numeric Stream Example 47 Numeric Stream Factory Method Example 48 Numeric Stream Factory Aggregation Method Example 49 Stream Boxing and UnBoxing Example 50 Numeric Stream Map Example 51 Stream Joining Example52 Stream Mapping and Counting Example53 Stream Summing and Averaging Example54 Stream Grouping By Example Part 155 Stream Grouping By Example Part 256 Stream Partitioning By Example57 Sequential vs Parallel Stream Example Part 158 Sequential vs Parallel Stream Example Part 259 Sequential vs Parallel Stream Use Case60 Parallel Stream When Not to Use Case Part 160 Parallel Stream When Not to Use Case Part 261 Optional Class Introduction62 Optional Class Example Part 163 Optional Methods Example Part 164 Optional If Present Method Example65 Optional Methods Example Part 266 Optional FlatMap Filter Example67 Interface Default and Static Method Introduction68 Default Method Sort Example69 Default Method Custom Sort Example70 Interface Method and Static Method Example","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2745650_cc33_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/lambda-with-functional-programming-in-java/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","Java"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37729cc4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736016-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376a8670-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef13-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"lambda-with-functional-programming-in-java8"},{"id":"3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28373","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Advanced Java Programming","headline":"Take Your Java Programming Skills To The Next Level.

Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, you’ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, you’ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

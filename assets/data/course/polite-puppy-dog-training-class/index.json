At 8 months Tyson started barking and lunging at people, at 10 months he became leash reactive towards dogs, by 1 year he had full out aggression towards puppies. When Julie realized that she had not learned proper techniques to deal with aggression – punishing Tyson for his behaviour made him lash out with greater intensity, she started looking for new ways to help her dog. Clicker training brought a new light to Tyson’s aggression and gave Julie a skill-set to manage his behaviour. This inspired Julie to learn about positive reinforcement training and set her on the path to becoming a professional positive reinforcement dog trainer.Julie is a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) through the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT). As the owner of a successful dog walking company in Toronto, Julie sharpens her training skills daily when she is out on her group walks. When she’s not dog walking you can find her teaching tricks to her own dogs.Both her dogs have titles in Rally Obedience and Freestyle but her greatest accomplishment is being able to bring her Puggle out with her on group walks. Treatpouch.com is her way of sharing with the world both the power of positive reinforcement training and the joy that comes from working with your dog.Julie is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Animal Behavior, at Memorial University, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.Andre YeuAndre’s passion for dog training began when he rescued his beagle, Duke, who suffered from on-leash reactivity and dog-aggression. Andre quickly discovered clicker training and the power of positive reinforcement, and through patience and care was able to help Duke overcome his fear and dislike of other dogs.Duke’s success gave Andre the confidence to volunteer and foster with a number of animal rescue organizations in the city. While each foster dog presented new challenges every dog could be helped through clicker training.In 2009, Andre decided to open When Hounds Fly! in Downtown Toronto, to make positive reinforcement training convenient and accessible to members of the community, and to improve the quality of life for dogs and dog owners in the downtown core. With the success of his school and the transformation he’s seen in the neighbourhood dogs, Andre decided that it would be a worthy cause to offer people the benefits of positive reinforcement based training regardless of where they live. Through Treatpouch.com Andre hopes to improve the lives of dogs and their people all over the world.Andre is a Karen Pryor Academy Certified Training Partner (KPA CTP), a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA), and a Truly Dog-Friendly Trainer. He grew up in Vancouver, has a bachelor’s degree in commerce, with honors, from the University of British Columbia, and lives in Toronto with his partner, Hyedie Hashimoto, and their rescue beagles, Duke and Petey.\n","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18719_2257_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/politepuppy/","language":"en","tags":["Lifestyle","Pet Care & Training","Dog Training"],"rating":3.8,"reviews":68,"isFree":false,"matches":["376a3850-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776e286-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738724-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd065-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376be600-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711626-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b260-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"polite-puppy-dog-training-class"},"related":[{"id":"377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742924","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.097Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Effective Learning - Learn to Learn","headline":"Learn how to learn effectively","description":"In this course you will learn the truth about effective learning.

Yet, it is absolutely an essential component of effective teaching. This course helps teachers learn how to effectively manage a classroom.  The primary goal of the course is to introduce a practical model for understanding and deconstructing the tasks involved in the process of classroom management and on learning practical, easy to implement strategies that enable teachers to spend more time teaching rather than disciplining! Specifically, participants in this course will learn:   Common misconceptions about classroom management How to develop effective rules and routines The role relationships play in one’s classroom management plan Techniques for preventing misbehavior Strategies for dealing with minor and more serious misbehavior Plus much, much more!   The course is divided into seven chapters.  Each chapter begins with a lecture presented by Dr. Tracey Garrett, a specialist in the field of classroom management.  Then, each chapter has a self-guided component where participants can review and expand on the material presented in the first lecture at their own pace.  Finally, the remaining lectures in each chapter are interviews of teachers at different grade levels offering insight into their practice. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18181_f6ad_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/classroom-management-essentials/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Teacher Training","Classroom Management"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":68,"isFree":false,"matches":["377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377582f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716449-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f820-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"classroom-management-essentials"},{"id":"376cd065-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"10812","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.175Z","updated":"2018-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"CCNA 2019 200-125 Video Boot Camp With Chris Bryant","headline":"Join The 90,000+ Students Who Are Learning Real-World Skills AND Earning Their CCNA!","description":"Please note:  The  last day to take the CCNA 200-125 exam is February 23, 2020.    My CCNA Video Boot Camp is totally refreshed for the latest version of the exam, and every video in this course (and all my courses) is fully downloadable, which allows you to study any time, anywhere -- on YOUR schedule.That includes my famous subnetting material and my BGP material -- and I'll make BGP clearer for you than any other instructor or course in the world.  You have my guarantee on that.Sign up now and earn the two most important Cisco certifications there are for one low price -- and join over 90,000 students in preparing for success in the exam room and in real-world networking.You receive immediate, full access to all 27+ hours of the course, and you can stream them or download them anytime you like.From my unbeatable, trick-free methods of teaching you how to perform binary, hex, and decimal conversions all the way through tough OSPF and EIGRP configs, you'll see it all right here on LIVE Cisco routers and switches - and you can watch every single session as often as you like.Thanks for making The Bryant Advantage part of your CCNA success story!

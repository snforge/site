Includes examples and a research paper template.","description":"These days, the expectation for publishing research papers has increased significantly in academia, in professional communities, and in science and technology disciplines worldwide. In scientific fields (especially in academia), both graduate students and faculty are expected to publish the results of their research work in journals and conference proceedings.  Publication of research or journal papers has also become a key measure for tenure and promotion assessments.  In fact, U.S. News, Gallop, and other external organizations often consider publications as a critical metric in their analysis and ranking of programs and institutions. Unfortunately, despite the widespread standard of writing and publishing research papers, most Universities don’t offer any formal training or mentorship on how to write effective papers.  The lack of guidance and resources has made it difficult, and at times frustrating, for graduate students and young researchers to properly organize and structure their papers for acceptance into publications. Whether you are a graduate student, conducting research, working towards a tenure, or you would like to advance your professional career in science, technology or academia, you will find this course greatly helpful.  You will no longer have to struggle or spend countless hours figuring out how to start your research paper, only to have it turn out not as good as you hoped. If you are a beginner, you can simply follow along with the easy steps outlining each section of your paper; even if you are more experienced, you may be surprised at how much you can improve your research writing technique from the strategies and examples presented in the course videos. This “Writing Research Papers: How to Write Research Paper Effectively” course will provide you with the valuable research guidance from a scholar with over 28 years of experience in research and teaching in higher education. Dr. Mohammad Noori has published over 200 technical and professional papers and currently serves as the technical editor, associate editor and a member of the editorial board of several prestigious journals.

Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.    Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don't know all the answers.    Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.    If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23972_35ee_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-speaking-smoothly-fluently-clearly-confidently/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Communication Skills"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":572,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738727-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"improve-communication-speak-smoothly-clearly-and-confidently"},{"id":"37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23926","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.883Z","updated":"2016-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Take Panic Out of Presenting with Simple Story Skills","headline":"Speaking can be hard, but it doesn't have to be.

The course also covers additional requirements that are sometimes difficult for students, including how to write effective thesis statements, creating topic sentences, drafting introductions and conclusions, and how to use transitional words and phrases. The course does include an opportunity to write a final essay for evaluation.

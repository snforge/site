These powerful techniques are often used in applied machine learning to achieve the best overall performance.In this unique course, after installing the necessary tools you will jump straight into the bagging method so as to get the best results from algorithms that are highly sensitive to specific data—for example, algorithms based on decision trees. Next, you will discover another powerful and popular class of ensemble methods called boosting. Here you'll achieve maximal algorithm performance by training a sequence of models, where each given model improves the results of the previous one. You will then explore a much simpler technique called voting, where results from multiple models are achieved using simple statistics such as the mean average. You will also work hands-on with algorithms such as stacking and XGBoost to improve performance.By the end of this course, you will know how to use a variety of ensemble algorithms in the real world to boost your machine learning models.Please note that a working knowledge of Python 3; the ability to run simple commands in Shell (Terminal); and also some basic machine learning experience are core prerequisites for taking and getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and programmed professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share this with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups, he was involved in. He failed miserably then. He then discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning, which he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to the “Keep it simple” mantra. He is the author of multiple bestselling video courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Real-World Deep Learning Python Projects and AI in Finance.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742004_65b9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769462-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python"},"related":[{"id":"377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742802","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.097Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Top Python and Django Web Development Bundle!","headline":"Learn Python Programming and The Django Web Framework In One Awesome Bundle!

SAP ABAP is the popular enterprise programming language developed by SAP and used by the biggest organisations in the world to run their business systems. In this SAP ABAP video training course, Peter Moxon introduces you to the fundamental skills needed to understand SAP ABAP programming and start creating your own ABAP programs. You will learn by watching the author actually perform the operation he is instructing on, as he explains step by step how to create and modify ABAP code. The training explains SAP ABAP from the ground up starting with the absolute basics to ensure you have a thorough grasp of the how best to program SAP enterprise systems. He slowly works you up through learning the key aspects of ABAP development introducing new concepts and language element included in SAP, and covers topics such building report interfaces and modularizing you programs with 'Includes', 'Forms' and 'Function Modules'. This training course not only gives you an a thorough insight into how the SAP programming language works but is delivered in such a way that everyone who takes the course will have absolutely no problem in understanding all the topics discussed. This course makes it so easy to learn SAP ABAP, you will be writing and testing out you own code in no time. So not to bog you down with theory this course focuses on learning through a hands-on approach and is packed full of practical step by step examples so that you are creating code from day one. Whether you're new to programming or just new to ABAP, this SAP ABAP course is your guide to rapid, real-world enterprise software development. Most SAP courses cost thousands of dollars and only allow you to scratch the surface of what it can do. While an SAP ABAP training curriculum can easy take over 50 days to complete studying full-time with SAP themselves nothing comes close to this video based course delivered by Peter Moxon who has been working with SAP ABAP and SAP BW for over 12 years. By the completion of this online training course, you will be fully versed, and capable of working with and creating your own ABAP programs in a commercial Environment.

This course aims to (1) familiarize you with the major operational problems and issues that confront managers, and (2) provide you with language, concepts, insights and tools to deal with these issues in order to gain competitive advantage through operations. This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring a career in designing and managing business processes, either directly (V.P. of Ops, COO) or indirectly (e.g. management consulting). The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between operations and other business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. Finally, a working knowledge of operations, which typically employs the greatest number of employees and requires the largest investment in assets, is indispensable for general managers and entrepreneurs. We will see how different business strategies require different business processes, and vice versa, how different operational capabilities allow and support different strategies to gain competitive advantage. A process view of operations will be used to analyze different key operational dimensions such as capacity management, flow time management, supply chain management, and quality management. We will also discuss developments such as lean operations, just-in-time operations, and time-based competition. Class is now in session!

It also explores the latest customer engagement thinking and use of social media tools. This course provides an understanding of the origins of services and service management theory, the core terms, principles and concepts found in Universal Service Management, the elements of a service management framework, including the operational system, and key roles within a service provider organization, workforce management system, and consumer management system. The course includes an introduction to “Outside-In\" (customer-centric) thinking, and its relationship to decisions on what products and services to offer, the makeup of those services, and the service support designed to manage the customer interactions, touchpoints, and customer service experience based upon 'moments of truth'. The course also describes the relationship between service functionality and successful customer outcomes, the principles of measuring and managing the customer's level of satisfaction with the service experience, and how these form the basis for defining problems, and responding to these through a continuous improvement program embedded within the service excellence system component of the service management framework.The Universal Service Management Body of Knowledge (USMBOK) is a series of reference publication used by professionals within a service provider organization or service business to design a systematic method for managing services.The USMBOK is a proud member of the International Best Practice Library, alongside the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge), and ITIL® (IT Infrastructure Library).","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/28951_0d50_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-usmbok-foundation-accelerator/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Operations","Management Skills"],"rating":2.4,"reviews":2,"isFree":false,"matches":["37716449-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e5701-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720086-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716443-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b745-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab314-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b266-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"service-management-fundamentals-also-usmboktm-foundation"},{"id":"37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28646","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.946Z","updated":"2014-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Managing Your Personal Finances","headline":"This is a short course on how to better manage your personal finances.","description":" Learn about Basic Money Management through an interactive presentation of a free PDF E-Book available from the MoneySENSE website (http://www.moneysense.gov.sg) entitled My Money Book.

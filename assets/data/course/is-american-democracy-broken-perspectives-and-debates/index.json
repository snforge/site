First I got out the newspaper and struggled to read keeping my elbows tucked in, that failed so I got out a novel but quickly got frustrated with the pages not staying open! Ok I thought, get out the laptop and catch up on some of those pdf ebooks I downloaded last week, that was ok for about half an hour until the battery died! Anyway in all that the time, the guy sitting next to me was really quiet and seemed quite relaxed, I glanced over and he had this really slim gray tablet thing on his lap and was reading. I'd never seen this before so interrupted him to inquire. 'Oh it's my Kindle' he said, 'a what?' I asked He replied 'I have to be honest I'm not one for gadgets but I love this, my wife bought it for my birthday as I like to travel light but miss reading stuff'. 'Yea, but aren't you limited to what's available to read' I said 'Well if you call 650,000 ebooks, 9000 blogs, newspapares and magazines as well as access to my personal documents then I suppose, yes!' I was stunned, so I came back with a smart reply..'I bet the battery runs out quick and you can only read it in a darkened room though?' He replied 'Well there's up to 1 month's battery and you can read in bright sunlight because this latest Kindle's screen is 50% brighter than previous ones, also I hate technology and gadgets so this is perfect for a non-techie like me. He then asked me what I did for a living and I said 'information publisher', 'tell me the titles of some of your books and I'll see if I can find them on Amazon to download' Well this WAS embarassing - I had NOTHING published in the Amazon Kindle format and had only just heard what one was! Dollar signs were going around in my head as to how much money I was LOSING by not having anything available on Amazon Kindle. Now I'm not trying to sell you a Kindle here, but after also learning that there are now something like 4 million of these around the world if you are the same as me and have previously published ebooks or are thinking about it now then you're probably worried that you may have already MISSED THE BOAT. I am now quickly catching up on how to join in on this amazingly lucrative opportunity  and have spent the last few weeks finding out exactly what's involved in becoming a publisher on Amazon Kindle and can now share that hard work with you. I thought it would be too unfair to keep all these gold nuggets of information to myself, especially as this marketplace is HUGE and there's more than enough for EVERYONE. So you can learn IMMEDIATELY what has taken me weeks to find out and be up and running WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. I'll show you how to find profitable niches that Amazon readers love, prepare your ebook in the correct Kindle format and upload it to Amazon. Amazon Kindle stores your ebook, easily lets its readers find you, takes payment then shares the revenue with you! Once uploaded you can leave it all on autopilot or drive traffic to your sales page, sit back and rake in the money! Sales Fact: There's a HUGE demand for the Amazon Kindle. That's right...On November 19, 2007, Amazon released the Kindle First Generation. Within five and a half hours it sold out! Keep in mind that the device remained out of stock for another five months, until late April 2008. You see, another huge factor for Amazon Kindle’s growth, is it makes things easy for users. eBooks are Cheaper Users can download the first chapter of any book for free, which can increase sales. iPhone owners can buy Kindle books and read them on their phones (This is huge!) Kindle is portable and simple to use for everyone. (Made for reading...good for people that are less techy) Besides eBooks, you can read newspapers, magazines and blogs on your kindle. It’s Fast... just buy a book and it is auto-delivered wirelessly in less than one minute. And Much More Benefits for YOU, the Publisher: As you've seen from above, you have access to a massive market of readers, who want specific ebooks. Amazon Kindle has made it so easy for anyone to use their system, and because of that, the market just keeps growing. What about security? Is it safe to put your ebooks online? Yes, ebooks bought at Amazon are protected by AZW DRM. This way Kindle readers can't share your books with their friends. Problems you may face: You may have written a great Book, but you don't know how to publish it onto Amazon Kindle. You're worried it's too technical and you just don't know how to start. - How do you make your Book digital? - How do you price your eBook?- How do you promote your eBook? - How do you improve your eBook, so that it adds value and sells?

Without a firm grasp of what's permissible by law as well as what's needed to drive adoption internally, you could wind up with a policy that is ruled unlawful by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Why does that matter?According to a recent research on 400 companies by Cap Gemini and MIT, digitally mature businesses across all categories generate more revenue, are more profitable and command higher market valuation than businesses that refrain from embracing new media. Social marketing was where we started. Social business is where we're headed.  You can't socialize the organization without rules.  Social media policy development is a critical component of socializing the enterprise. Learn how to draft social media polices for managers and clients.This course will save you time and money by accelerating the development time you need to draft and gain approval for a social media policy. It will also minimize the risk of instituting an unlawful social media policy, like many major organizations have done already. Save your organization the time and expensive of having to learn your lesson in court.You'll also get my world renown social media policy template , to get you off and running quickly with everything you need to be aware of to draft an effective social media policy.  Plus, you'll learn the rationale behind the language, so you can explain to your legal counsel, manager or client. In this course, you get the benefit of my real world experience developing social media policies for major organizations including Edison International, the United States Marine Corps and many others. Social media has become an integral part of our personal lives. Unless you take the time to specify how (not if) employees can use social media at work, you risk forfeiting the chance of alienating the best and the brightest candidates.  If you're a US-based organization, you might unknowingly violate the National Labor Relations Act. But regardless of where you're based, draconian social media policies have the potential to severely tarnish your organization's reputation. Don't follow the International Olympic Committee's example.  Get it right the first time.

This class on Udemy is a distillation of the topics that students have responded to most positively and have most often asked about. We start with a look at the physical world of the Greeks, and then take up the Iliad of Homer. After that we look in detail how Herodotus presents the beginning of the great conflict between Greece and Persian, and finish up with an overview of the various Greek philosophers. If you're taking a class in Greek culture somewhere and need a little help, or if you are a motivated autodidact, I'm sure you'll find these lectures a good step forward in your understanding and appreciation of the world of the Greeks.

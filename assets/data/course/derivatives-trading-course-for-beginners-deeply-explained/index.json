Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.Vue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.To get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.If you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.You will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746764_7fa1_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Web Development","Vue JS"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b22b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js"},{"id":"3776bb77-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28172","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2019-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Practical Trading on Financial Futures & Options Markets","headline":"2nd Edition Course - Interactive learning on financial markets!","description":" This is our revised 2nd edition course with significant improvements as a step by step guide on how professionals trade the markets.  Experience practical interactive learning beyond classroom & theory!  While going through our course, you'll execute trades on a trading platform as we walk you through set ups each week!

This course will concentrate on Technical Analysis, and you will learn everything I know about correctly reading stock charts in about 80 minutes!  By training yourself to read and correctly interpret the information charts give you, you will be able to predict which way a stock will most likely move in the near future.  Charts can actually give you a glimpse of the future, and are a must have tool in the successful trader's arsenal.In my Beginners Guide to Technical Analysis of Stock Charts here on Udemy, I covered fifty different technical indicators.  In this course, I teach the one indicator I use for all of my Buy and Sell Signals, and it's accuracy rate is about 80%. Two of the most important lessons included in this course are how to handle a false Buy Signal to keep losses to an absolute minimum, and when to lock in profits to maximize your gains. The trading strategy I teach in this course will provide you with a plan for entering and exiting trades with confidence. I look forward to helping you to become a successful Trader!Happy Trading! Tom  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2762_231c_20.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/swing-trading-the-stock-market/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Finance","Swing Trading"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":349,"isFree":false,"matches":["37722790-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab310-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b0a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb77-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37797a91-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37790564-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769468-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"simple-strategy-for-swing-trading-the-stock-market"}]}}

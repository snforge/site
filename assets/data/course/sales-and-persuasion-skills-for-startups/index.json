But one thing the winners all have in common Is – the ability to influence others. The ability to sell their ideas, sell their products, sell their service. And the graveyard of business startups is littered with companies that failed to grasp that most important, essential skill - the art of persuasion. That's what this course delivers in spades. The ability to get people to say 'YES'. So – what is unique about this course? Unlike so many courses, Len Smith is always available should you have any queries. Just email him - he's here to help. It is a living, growing course - unlike any other course, as students suggest new topics, Len adds them as bonus lessons (he calls them fireside chats). No extra cost, the course just keeps on improving. It is not designed for salespeople wanting to boost their career. Salesman of the Month! It’s not ‘evangelical’ and it’s not designed to tell you how wonderful you are – what fantastic sales talents you’ve got hidden away, just waiting to be revealed.  No – it’s for real people. Entrepreneurs. Startups. Businesspeople - starting out - who recognise they have a crying need to learn how to get other people to say YES. And that’s what we mean by sales techniques in this course. Not just selling product – although, that IS important, so we do cover all the essentials about selling your product - but it’s also about getting others to buy into your ideas. Things like, How To…. Understand people’s motives for buying – some real surprises there! Make sure you always have a clear objective – never ‘winging it’, hoping that something will come out at the end Understand different personality types – and how to turn their personality traits to your advantage Turn needs into wants - and raise the profitability of what you do, what you sell Turn objections into sales opportunities Gain control and keep the upper hand in any discussion Apply the perfect test to see if others are raising smoke screens or holding something back Overcome ‘price-itis’. Never ever having to sell down on price Understand ‘buying signals’ How to write a professional, compelling proposal Discover the best-kept secrets for overcoming road blocks like – “I’ll think about it” “I’ll think it over” Make it easy for your prospects to buy, for your business partners to say ‘yes’ There are countless courses on sales techniques. Mostly developed by trainers. This course is based on years' of personal-face-to-face experience from an expert who has worked at the coal face. Len Smith has many years' experience in sales & marketing with companies like IBM and has been associated with a number of start-up successes. Developing business and marketing plans, market research, product branding, VC funding and strategic business development. He's worked as a non-exec, involved in MBOs, company sales and a stock market flotation. He has also helped clients make the difficult leap from Europe to success in North America and the Asia Pacific Region. Clients have included IBM, Travelex, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Welcom, Marks & Spencer Financial Services and Manchester Business School. Now he shares his persuasion techniques with you.

Designed for entrepreneurs, businesses, and junior developers.","description":"Are you a creative or entrepreneur that wishes you could speak tech with your web development team? Maybe you wish you could code a bit yourself?  Programming for Non-Programmers is online course designed to help non-programmers communicate more efficiently with developers.  Because leading a development team (without being a developer yourself) can sometimes feels like “talking about dancing”, I've created an interactive and easy to follow environment in which to learn the basics.  And for developers just getting started, think of this as the primer to help kickstart your career.  If you're running a tech start-up, it's essential that you familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of web development. Ultimately knowing how to \"talk to the talk\" will help you communicate better with developers, and overall just look really cool.  What You'll Learn   In this course we'll tackle some development principles to get you on the right path. We'll look at questions like, \"Front-end vs. Back-end?\", \"Is UX necessary for my project?\", \"What is this Javascript function thingy, and why am I passing it strange math equations to it?\".  What coding languages should I use for my next project?Which CMS is right for the job?What are the stages of web development?What deliverables do I need to provide my developer? (FYI - This is important and often neglected or done poorly)Reading code & basic developing principles to get us startedKey concepts of programming that are the found in every programming languageUnderstanding Javascript Variables & LogicLooking for corporate training?  I'm based in New York City, and available to bring my workshop Programming for Non-Programmers to your company.

My intent was to get a good overview of what the heck programming actually is, and better understand the language/terms associated with it.  I  certainly got that.  I also appreciated your passion for teaching.

Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.Vue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.To get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.If you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.You will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746764_7fa1_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Web Development","Vue JS"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b22b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js"},{"id":"3776bb75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28295","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2016-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn Web Designing & HTML5/CSS3 Essentials in 4-Hours","headline":"Convert Photoshop Designs into Stunning HTML5 & CSS3 websites with confidence.

The different types of brushes that you can use as well as installing some new brushes, so you can do some really nice affects on your design. 3. The Key to Custom Shapes Shapes is something we use a lot when we're designing a web page. It's used to make the layout and lots of other elements on the screen. We get used to this really useful tool in this lesson. 4. The Core of Photoshop, Layers and Groups Layers are the most important part of Photoshop, as they allow you to make changes to specific areas on the screen. You can further group these layers together to make it more manageable when you're designing. 5. The Shortcuts to Moving and Resizing In this lesson we're going to be looking at how to move layers around the screen and how to resize them using the free transform tool, something you will use a lot in your designs. 6. Getting the Most from Zooming and Panning We are going to look at how to look around your design and see the details by using the zoom tool. So in this lesson we look into two very important features of using Photoshop daily, zooming and panning. 7. Creating Cool Effects with Blending Modes Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other and effects are different things you can apply to single layer, things like shadows, inners shadows, gradients etc. 8. Text, Love it or Hate it Texts are one of the trickiest things in Photoshop, reason being that its not really made to do it. So in this lesson, we're going to find easy ways to work with Photoshop and texts. 9. Clean Web Page Design using Photoshop We are going to be creating a webpage design in Photoshop.

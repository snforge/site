Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"25311","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.887Z","updated":"2013-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Use Your Creative Mindpower To Transform Your Life","headline":"Learn proven techniques to make the most of your mindpower","description":"Can this course really transform your life? Yes!

It is designed to teach other counselors and coaches these very powerful and effective techniques for helping their clients too. The program is also a great compliment to any helping process by providing structure and tools for use with clients. I combined the classics with some of the newest, most powerful personal transformation technologies available today to create this interactive process for Overcoming Childhood Trauma, personal healing and development. These include Gestalt psychology, Ego-State therapy, Inner Family Systems Therapy, Precision Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Transactional Analysis, Inner Child work, Parts Integration, Hypnosis, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Schema Therapy, and many other models.

Each video also has supportive text to reveal any hidden aspects of yoga and is accompanied by a supportive manual for total understanding of each pose.  In this course, you will find:  the complete Course Series 2, which includes 4 long progressive lessons named 2A - 2D. the complete Short Series on Pranayama, Preparatory, Saluation and Stretching. amazingly detailed manuals for both Course 2A - 2D and of the Short series to provide additional information on the video lessons. The Course Series 2 is a step-by-step development form that progresses from least challenging to most dynamic postures. Course 2A - 2D videos areapproximately 45 - 60 minutes in length so if you only have 5-25 minutes of practise time, work with the Short Series. It is always best to start at the beginning of each Short Series before going to the higher levels.  Once you have mastered Course 1 & 2, I hope you will continue your practice with the final course series on Course 3, and continue mastering the Short Series that is found in each of the different courses.  Thank you for your interest in Yoga with Perumal and I hope you enjoy the series!    ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20321_8e78_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/yoga-with-perumal-course-series-2/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":5,"reviews":2,"isFree":false,"matches":["3772279a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711620-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"authentic-yoga-experience-series-2"},{"id":"3772279a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"20320","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.698Z","updated":"2018-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Authentic Yoga Experience Series 1","headline":"Immerse Yourself, FROM SCRATCH, into the most authentic Yoga Experience","description":"Course 1 is the 1st part of a 3 Part Series.

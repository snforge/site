How do you learn that one stimulus is associated with another (classical conditioning)? How do you learn that your own behavior can make something in your environment change (operant conditioning)? And how do classical and operant conditioning change the way you behave? As it turns out, these two forms of learning--and what they tell you about the predictability of your world--can change your behavior in surprising ways.

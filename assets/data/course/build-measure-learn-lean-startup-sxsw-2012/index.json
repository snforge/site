Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24653","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.885Z","updated":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Startup Attention and PR 101","headline":"How to Launch a Product - Learn Marketing and Public Relations skills to make an awesome product launch from Ben Parr!","description":"ANNOUNCEMENT: 50% of the revenue from this course will be donated to THRIVE-GULU, a not-for-profit building rehabilitation and community centers across Africa.   Startup Attention & PR 101\" is a deeper look at how to better work with the press.

But one thing the winners all have in common Is – the ability to influence others. The ability to sell their ideas, sell their products, sell their service. And the graveyard of business startups is littered with companies that failed to grasp that most important, essential skill - the art of persuasion. That's what this course delivers in spades. The ability to get people to say 'YES'. So – what is unique about this course? Unlike so many courses, Len Smith is always available should you have any queries. Just email him - he's here to help. It is a living, growing course - unlike any other course, as students suggest new topics, Len adds them as bonus lessons (he calls them fireside chats). No extra cost, the course just keeps on improving. It is not designed for salespeople wanting to boost their career. Salesman of the Month! It’s not ‘evangelical’ and it’s not designed to tell you how wonderful you are – what fantastic sales talents you’ve got hidden away, just waiting to be revealed.  No – it’s for real people. Entrepreneurs. Startups. Businesspeople - starting out - who recognise they have a crying need to learn how to get other people to say YES. And that’s what we mean by sales techniques in this course. Not just selling product – although, that IS important, so we do cover all the essentials about selling your product - but it’s also about getting others to buy into your ideas. Things like, How To…. Understand people’s motives for buying – some real surprises there! Make sure you always have a clear objective – never ‘winging it’, hoping that something will come out at the end Understand different personality types – and how to turn their personality traits to your advantage Turn needs into wants - and raise the profitability of what you do, what you sell Turn objections into sales opportunities Gain control and keep the upper hand in any discussion Apply the perfect test to see if others are raising smoke screens or holding something back Overcome ‘price-itis’. Never ever having to sell down on price Understand ‘buying signals’ How to write a professional, compelling proposal Discover the best-kept secrets for overcoming road blocks like – “I’ll think about it” “I’ll think it over” Make it easy for your prospects to buy, for your business partners to say ‘yes’ There are countless courses on sales techniques. Mostly developed by trainers. This course is based on years' of personal-face-to-face experience from an expert who has worked at the coal face. Len Smith has many years' experience in sales & marketing with companies like IBM and has been associated with a number of start-up successes. Developing business and marketing plans, market research, product branding, VC funding and strategic business development. He's worked as a non-exec, involved in MBOs, company sales and a stock market flotation.

Learn why hundreds of companies, from financial services companies like Wealthfront to social companies like IMVU to large corporations such as Intuit, are using this revolutionary technique. But what is Lean Startup, or more importantly, how do I implement Lean principles into my own company? Well, to answer that question, we've brought in the Godfather of Lean Startup himself, Eric Ries. Not only has he written the book on \"The Lean Startup,\" but he has also now created THE course on Lean Startup. Eric brought in all of the leaders in the movement to talk to you about what lean startup is and how to implement it into your company. This course is the real deal - it's the most content you'll ever get on the Lean Startup in one place. More importantly, it is curated - Eric has personally taken the most important aspects of Lean Startup and condensed it into a single course. And then he added a few dozen case studies of it by including bonus material from the definitive conferences on the subject.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8467_e90b_8.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Lean Startup"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":369,"isFree":false,"matches":["376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c0d13-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f825-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-lean-startup"},{"id":"376a8673-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"1769","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.169Z","updated":"2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"The Lean Startup Talk at Stanford E-Corner","headline":"Debunking Myths of Entrepreneurship A startup is not a \"doll house\" version of a larger enterprise.","description":"Debunking Myths of Entrepreneurship A startup is not a &quot;doll house&quot; version of a larger enterprise. It\u0003s a human institution trying to start something new under extreme conditions of uncertainty, says author Eric Ries. It\u0003s not that some founders have better ideas than others, and this is what dictates success. What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find &quot;the pivot&quot;- the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling. And, more critically, that they can find their market before they run out of money.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1769_95c2_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup-debunking-myths-of-entrepreneurship/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Lean Startup"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":626,"isFree":true,"matches":["377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-lean-startup-talk-at-stanford-e-corner"}]}}

If you won't like what you see, don't worry: there is a 30 day money back guaranty on all Udemy courses :) In App Purchases are the Holy Grail of app monetization. But for years it has been a real hassle for newbie developers to add In App Purchases to their apps. One had to be a coding genius to understand all the aspects of implementing IAP. Just take a look at Apple's documentation. This was just overly complicated for me! I wanted something simple and fast! Than I found MKStoreKit by Mugunth Kumar. MKStoreKit does all the magic of dealing with all that complicated stuff. Hurray!!! But, wait. I found no comprehensive MKStoreKit tutorial explaining how to use MKStoreKit. There isn't any documentation at all on how to implement it into your Xcode project!(besides Kumar's brief description which just isn't enough) I have dug myself into the code and after countless sleepless nights I have made this MKStoreKit tutorial course for you. It documents every step you have to make to learn in order to take advantage of in app monetization. Note: for now MKStoreKit is not advised for auto-renewable subscriptions, but if you want to add consumabels or non-consumables, take this course now:) This course covers all you will ever need to know about adding In App Purchases to your app using MKStoreKit. ☛ Take a look at the FREE lecture inside ☛ iOS6 ready ☛ simple, fast, easy What are you waiting for?

Growing your customer base to achieve higher sales.","description":"In my Niche Marketing class you will discover how a streamlined niche marketing strategy will help you to grow your customer base who is ready to buy from you. It doesn't matter if you sell products or services.To succeed in promoting your business, it is important that you do not waste your marketing budget on unfruitful exercises. You do not want to waste your marketing efforts on the wrong people, especially those people who could not afford your product or services, or even those who would not buy your service or product anyway no matter how hard you may try.Many people mistakenly believe that marketing any type of business means having to pay for online or newspaper adverts and the buyers will come and buy. While this would be fantastic, in reality though this approach just doesn't work long time, if at all. And before you come to realise this, your marketing budget will be depleated and you will come to the realisation that your 'business has failed'.It's time to rethink your approach and accept the fact that whatever you offer, products or services, will only appeal to a defined niche market. Let's say you are selling apples, then anyone who doesn't like apples will not buy from you, even though they may have seen your advert. This is the dilemma you need to address, which is done through targeted advertising to a niche market - ultimately the market in which you operate.My niche marketing class is full of valuable tips and advice which makes it easy for everyone to develop a marketing strategy that works and which helps to grow your customer base and business as a whole.I also share with you the 5-step niche marketing method which includes:Identifying and targeting your niche marketHow to find your niche marketCollecting testimonialsHow to create niche marketing materials for your businessWays of how to contact your niche marketRemember: Niche Marketing does not need to be scary or difficult.All you need to do is to put into practice what you have learned.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20752_d801_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/expand-your-customer-base-by-narrowing-your-marketing-focus/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"niche-marketing-made-easy"},{"id":"37722797-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19958","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.698Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Winning Sales Script System for Sales and Marketing","headline":"Learn how to build a winning sales script system to close more sales, today.","description":"","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19958_c3cd_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Sales","Sales Skills"],"rating":4,"reviews":11,"isFree":false,"matches":["37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742360-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b02-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing"},{"id":"37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"18569","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.692Z","updated":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Professional Selling","headline":"Anyone can learn how to become more persuasive and how to deliver a professional quality sales presentation.","description":"Sales is a critical function for any business.  It provides the revenue that pays for everything else the company does.  Professional level sales people make six-figure incomes and interact with billion dollar companies, like Walmart and Kroger.

But one thing the winners all have in common Is – the ability to influence others. The ability to sell their ideas, sell their products, sell their service. And the graveyard of business startups is littered with companies that failed to grasp that most important, essential skill - the art of persuasion. That's what this course delivers in spades. The ability to get people to say 'YES'. So – what is unique about this course? Unlike so many courses, Len Smith is always available should you have any queries. Just email him - he's here to help. It is a living, growing course - unlike any other course, as students suggest new topics, Len adds them as bonus lessons (he calls them fireside chats). No extra cost, the course just keeps on improving. It is not designed for salespeople wanting to boost their career. Salesman of the Month! It’s not ‘evangelical’ and it’s not designed to tell you how wonderful you are – what fantastic sales talents you’ve got hidden away, just waiting to be revealed.  No – it’s for real people. Entrepreneurs. Startups. Businesspeople - starting out - who recognise they have a crying need to learn how to get other people to say YES. And that’s what we mean by sales techniques in this course. Not just selling product – although, that IS important, so we do cover all the essentials about selling your product - but it’s also about getting others to buy into your ideas. Things like, How To…. Understand people’s motives for buying – some real surprises there! Make sure you always have a clear objective – never ‘winging it’, hoping that something will come out at the end Understand different personality types – and how to turn their personality traits to your advantage Turn needs into wants - and raise the profitability of what you do, what you sell Turn objections into sales opportunities Gain control and keep the upper hand in any discussion Apply the perfect test to see if others are raising smoke screens or holding something back Overcome ‘price-itis’. Never ever having to sell down on price Understand ‘buying signals’ How to write a professional, compelling proposal Discover the best-kept secrets for overcoming road blocks like – “I’ll think about it” “I’ll think it over” Make it easy for your prospects to buy, for your business partners to say ‘yes’ There are countless courses on sales techniques. Mostly developed by trainers. This course is based on years' of personal-face-to-face experience from an expert who has worked at the coal face. Len Smith has many years' experience in sales & marketing with companies like IBM and has been associated with a number of start-up successes. Developing business and marketing plans, market research, product branding, VC funding and strategic business development. He's worked as a non-exec, involved in MBOs, company sales and a stock market flotation. He has also helped clients make the difficult leap from Europe to success in North America and the Asia Pacific Region.

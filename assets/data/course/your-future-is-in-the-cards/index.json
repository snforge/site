Now, you can give and receive immediate and specific answers about romance, money, and career. You can predict the future using an item found in virtually every household--an ordinary deck of playing cards. Your Future Is In The Cards: Become a Fortune Teller in 7 Days demystifies the art of fortune-telling and delivers a step-by-step system of interpreting playing cards at a professional level. This crash course teaches you everything you need to know to begin a fortune telling with playing cards and giving accurate and detailed readings in just one week. The Method This course takes an analytical approach to cartomancy which means you’ll learn to read the cards using a logical, step-by-step process. Specific meanings are assigned based on card numbers, suits and even suit colors (red or black), creating a commonsense method that is easy to apply. Each card has a basic meaning but you will find new associations for the cards as you work with them. And, as you progress, your intuition will fill in the gaps. Through your readings, you will help yourself and your clients: · Perceive the present more clearly · Understand hidden influences · Uncover blocks and obstacles · Find solutions · See how the future may unfold What You Will Learn in this Course First, you get the basics, which means understanding the parts of a standard playing card deck, guidelines for cartomancers, and learning to shuffle and select cards. Next, you’ll learn what each card represents. Then, you’ll discover new techniques to gain more information from the cards to add important details to your readings in this playing card reading course. Masterfully, you will learn to pull precise details from the cards revealing physical descriptions (“Your future romantic partner has a dark complexion--perhaps of African American, Latin, East Indian, heritage. He’s stocky in build and he has facial hair”), and timing of events (“A job offer will be presented in the 2nd week of spring”). Take this course and become a fortune teller in 7 days!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/24351_a7c2_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/your-future-is-in-the-cards/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Religion & Spirituality","Clairvoyance"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":150,"isFree":false,"matches":["37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d38-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37766d52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b53-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"your-future-is-in-the-cards"},"related":[{"id":"377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28632","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.947Z","updated":"2015-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn Self-Hypnosis in Only Minutes a Day","headline":"Discover a Simple Self-Hypnosis Method to Add More Positive Habits into Your Life","description":" In this self-paced course you will learn about hypnosis, trance and altered states.  Practice hands-on exercises as you are guided step by step.  By the end of this course you will learn a simple, 3 step process for using self-hypnosis.  Learn how to write your own hypnotic suggestions, to program your subconscious mind to adopt new habits that make life better.Change unwanted habits, attitudes and behaviors and adopt NEW habits to enjoy better health, better finances, and have happy fulfilling relationships.Becky Hays, Certified Master NLP Hypnotherapist, produces media for self-improvement, and runs a private coaching practice in downtown Austin where she has met with clients for over 12 years to help them transform their lives.  She also holds remote sessions and has clients from Hawaii to New York and beyond.Becky is a member of the National Guild of Hypnotists, National Society of NLP, and was a Presenting Faculty Member at the Natl Guild of Hypnotists International Convention where she. taught hypnotists elements of the NLP meta model.  She also coproduced the amazing movie Beyond Belief which explores the powerful of the subconscious mind, and is now in its 10th years of global distribution.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/28632_50b7_4.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/self-hypnosis/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Personal Transformation","Self-Hypnosis"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":31,"isFree":false,"matches":["37755be6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749893-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef14-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711627-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learn-self-hypnosis-in-only-minutes-a-day"},{"id":"37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28380","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.946Z","updated":"2013-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learning to Learn","headline":"Improve your studies, improve your career, improve your life.

In this course, you'll become familiar with specific book apps in different categories, and learn how these apps are pushing the boundaries of the medium. We will NOT be discussing plain text titles available on the Kindle, Nook, & other platforms. Instead we'll focus on multimedia, interactive books that are released as individual apps, such as London: A City Through Time (available in the iTunes store for iPads). In each section of the course you'll watch video demos of particular interactive book apps, read several interesting articles and discuss everything in the class forums. There is a total of about 8-10 hours of work, which you can do at your own pace, with perpetual access. We'll have discussions about the future of the book as a medium. ● What do these changes mean for readers, libraries, authors, and publishers? ● What are the qualities of a delightful reading experience? ● How are these apps enabling learning and which features and qualities enable a the best experience for readers? A resource guide is included, with links to recommended book apps, additional readings, publishers to watch and blogs to follow.

Studying the chakras separately one day at a time breaks down the information so the depth of each can be easily digested. This Chakras for Beginners course will show you how effective consistent practice with clear intention can be for finding and keeping peace. Studying the energy within guides you to find a deeper understanding of yourself. Following my instruction you will learn what the chakras are and how focusing on balancing chakra will bring you greater self-understanding, self-confidence, and less stress. So what is a chakra? The term chakra translates to wheel or disk. Within our body there are seven major chakras, which can be thought of as energy centers. Each chakra correlates to our levels of consciousness, from the most primitive to transcendent. The seven chakras are: Muladhara (root), Svadhisthana (sweetness), Manipura (lustrious gem), Anahata (unstuck), Vissudha (purification), Ajna (Command Center), and Sahasara (thousand fold). The first chakra starts with the most primitive level of consciousness and gradually develops until you reach the seventh chakra and highest level of consciousness. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18273_8928_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-the-chakras/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":3.7,"reviews":5,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742363-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"7-day-yoga-routine-increase-energy-and-balance-your-chakras"}]}}

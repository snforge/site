With SketchUp Pro, you have the ultimate tool for creating just that; LayOut. LayOut is the companion program that comes with SketchUp Pro. It takes your 3D model and creates 2D snapshots of your model and places them onto \"pages\" so you can add dimensions, annotations, and other information in order to create a complete set of construction documents. This course gives you a complete introduction to LayOut, teaching you all the basics you need to know in order to create a presentation of your model. In addition, you'll learn how to prepare your SketchUp model for LayOut. Have complete control over the look of you LayOut viewports by properly organizing your SketchUp model and creating scenes. After learning how to create a LayOut document, you'll also learn advanced techniques in SketchUp for creating section cuts, hatch patterns, and poche effects. This video course includes the SketchUp to LayOut PDF ebook which has all of the lessons from this video course, and other valuable tutorials which you can follow. You'll also get the CAD hatch material library and style library so you can apply traditional hatch patterns to your model. By the end of this course, you'll have a complete understanding of how to create a SketchUp model specifically for LayOut, as well as how to create a full set of construction documents inside LayOut.

Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"37720084-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19615","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.696Z","updated":"2012-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Unity 3d Game Development - iOS, Android, & Web - Beginners","headline":"Want to get into making high quality games, but don't know where to start?

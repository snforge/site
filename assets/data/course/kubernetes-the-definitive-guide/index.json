This course will help you get familiar with DevOps concepts. We will first configure our Docker machine, do build and run docker containers, then we turn our sight towards Kubernetes. We will build our test environment with the help of Minikube. Deploy our Pods, Services, ReplicaSets and Deployments. As an ending we will create an ELKF stack to collect logs from our containers and I'm going to show you how to index a standalone python application.Check out the supporting github repository in the links for the resources.Let's get started!Cheers,Daniel","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2747140_0eba.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-the-definitive-guide/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Kubernetes"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["377a8c03-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777f3f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d3c-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778421b-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab311-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37702bc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"kubernetes-the-definitive-guide"},"related":[{"id":"377a8c03-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2743660","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.151Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Troubleshooting Kubernetes","headline":"Practical solutions to common issues faced while deploying, managing, and operating your Kubernetes clusters","description":"Containers are changing the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. Consequently, container orchestration has become a critical piece of infrastructure for enterprises on their digital transformation journey. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration.This course provides a tour of how to debug issues with the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure and presents a working conceptual model of how clusters operate. You will be addressing common problems faced by developers in cluster management, monitoring, and logging. Subsequently, we examine common issues when creating and deploying apps on Kubernetes.By the end of the course, you'll have gained full control of your Kubernetes infrastructure and will be able to manage it with ease.Please note a working knowledge of Kubernetes is required for this course.About the AuthorPradipta Kumar BanerjeeIBM, Senior Technical Staff Member, Bangalore, IndiaPradipta is a Senior Technical Staff Member for the IBM Cloud Private platform and leads cloud-native platform initiatives for IBM Power Microprocessor.

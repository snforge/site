WIN 'EM OVER WITH WEB VIDEO PART 2: Stand Out and Move Up in Search Engine Results with Effective Web Video (HOW TO PREVENT A RAIN OUT ON YOUR FIELD OF DREAMS WITH WEB VIDEO):  This is a beginner-friendly course for busy professionals who want to learn how to create effective web video AND boost their search engine optimization efforts. Students will learn the basics of web video production and search engine optimization. This course provides video, screen records, and sample files for busy professionals who want the most essential information presented to them in a manner that can be quickly and easily digested and applied in under a half day (4 hours). After successful completion, students will learn video production and SEO for Video basics. The course instructor is Kamala Appel, aka \"the key\" in KEA Productions. She has produced numerous documentary-style web videos for small business owners and non-profit organizations since 2002. Ms. Appel worked in Hollywood in licensing at Universal Studios and Business Affairs at International Creative Management (ICM) and in programming at the Sundance Film Festival. She is a graduate of Yale University and where earned a BA in American Studies with a concentration in Film Studies and USC's School of Cinema-Television, now Cinematic Arts, where she earned her Master's degree.  She is also a certified SEO Practitioner. \"What I love most about producing videos for small business owners and nonprofits is the opportunity to work with passionate professionals who are experts in their field. I feel very fortunate to be able to use my skills as a visual storyteller to help others. Unfortunately, I am not able to help every worthy business owner out there because not everyone can afford to hire a professional like myself to produce a video for them.  That is why I decided to develop a course that could empower more businesses, start ups, and nonprofits compete and share their passion with the world.\" Ms. Appel has been a faculty member at a number of accredited offline colleges throughout the State of California.  As an experienced film and multimedia instructor, she takes into consideration the three main learning styles: aural (listening- you can listen to the modules), visual (you can watch the videos with images that will hopefully stay with you), and kinetic (movement- you can exercise your kinetic learning style by taking notes and doing the quizzes). In addition to the modules or short training videos, there are samples and screen recordings * (Including FinalCut Pro and After FX demos) for all three stages: pre-production or planning, production or shooting, and post-production or editing; so that you can follow along throughout the process. To further your learning experience, there is an interactive coaching program that complements the e-learning course and supplementary materials. During the coaching calls we will delve more deeply into the materials with scenarios and go over the quizzes. Questions can be answered live and students can participate in interviews with other industry experts. As someone who has purchased this Web Video Production course, you get your first month's membership for free. So if you are a busy professional and you want to be able to have access to the information you need to take your business or organization to the next level with web video and SEO for video basics, then this is the course for you. If you want to positively persuade your target audience, your bottom line, and boost your SEO efforts, then again, this course is for you. Again, this is an accelerated course so that you can get through the materials in a manageable way while trying to stay sane throughout your busy life. Please note: The first several video modules are free to allow you to preview the style. These opening videos give students a chance to learn some history and the general philosophy that will influence the core content. The \"meat\" of the course is only available to paid subscribers who want to invest further in their online marketing efforts.

If you want to learn internet marketing, if you're looking to build a business that has a real consistent, dependable income but have been struggling to make money online so far, then YES you're in the right place... You may or may not like everything you read on this page and some of it may sting a little, but I've never been ones to tell the truth with a sugar coating... Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... And here it is, it's the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) But why is that? Surely if everyone's buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest '1 click to riches' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn't they? Why are there so many people failing? Think about it like this... Most marketers aren't lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? Well here's the cold, hard truth: Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap 'systems' that don't work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass 'gurus' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it's not your fault. It's simply the nature of the industry. But look - If you've found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no \"magic bullet\". You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works! And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - And that's why I'm so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you'll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it's all geared up to you finally getting the results you've always wanted FAST! Inside you'll get a complete system: ● You'll know exactly what business to start ● How to get an unlimited amount of free traffic. ● How to create killer evergreen products that are guaranteed to sell ● How to attract partners that will allow your business to grow really really fast ● How to put your business on autopilot ● And how to scale your business to any income level that you desire. By the time you finish this internet marketing course you’ll have learnt internet marketing and you'll own a ROCK SOLID, profitable business. Your only decision will be to keep it or sell it. Seriously you'll have a real asset, an asset that's worth selling for a lump sum of money. How would you like a thirty thousand dollar payday? What would you do with that much cash? Think about this right now: What's it worth to you to have the skill to build a business that could produce that type of money on demand... ... Or to own a profitable evergreen business, the type of business that we described earlier (high traffic website, thousands of subscribers, powerful JV partners and relationships) Something that provides you with the total freedom to live the life you choose... What are you waiting for... below you'll find we are giving away almost an entire hour of this course's life changing videos. In fact, you can watch over 60 minutes of this course (longer than some entire courses on Udemy) for FREE. I guarantee, if you watch just the FREE videos on this page, you'll discover not only that this Udemy course is something very special and different, but you'll also discover something special about yourself that will redefine and clarify what \"personal success\" can mean for you, and how you can go about achieving it, in your lifetime!

Also included is a complete database of websites to use for your online marketing campaign as well as a basic online marketing plan for any small business. The videos range in length from one minute to approximately nine minutes and are divided into two categories: lecture style and hands-on. The lecture style videos feature the course founder, Tom Aikins, explaining the principles of a particular subject. Then, the hands-on videos that immediately follow these videos show step-by-step how the particular technique or application is done using a screen capture program. These videos show viewers where to click and exactly what to do as the particular operation is being demonstrated and they can view the instructor’s computer screen exactly as it appears so the learning process is simple and easy to follow. This product, in following with Google’s continuing attempts to more and more engage small business owners, was created for people who have small- to medium-sized businesses and have a website that is not effective in generating sales for them. The types of business that can benefit from the OME course is almost limitless. Covering service businesses, professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc), retailers, food service, manufacturing and any others that need more traffic from their website, the OME training course can help any of these businesses improve their website traffic. And please don't forget that this includes a database of websites that are critical for use in online marketing. The cost of compiling this database yourself would be greater than the cost of the entire course. Updates to the database will also be sent to subscribers as new websites are found and tested.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/14728_4e83_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/online-marketing-excellence/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722798-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"online-marketing-excellence"},{"id":"376e08e2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"12196","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.177Z","updated":"2018-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"SEO beginners : how I get 1,000 visitors a day with SEO","headline":"Search Engine Optimization, SEO. Learn how, as a freelancer working from home, I get 1,000 visitors a day. SEO easy!","description":"SEO beginner? Let me show you how to get high ranking in searches by learning the basics of search engine optimization. It's SEO easy!In this course, I show you how I get 1,000 visitors a day - that's a third of a million people a year. And it's not the mythical 'hits' that some people boast about. These are real live humans.AND IF YOU ARE A WEB DESIGNER, APPLICATION DEVELOPER, FREELANCER, THIS COULDN'T BE MORE APPROPRIATE. YOU ARE SELLING TO EXACTLY THE SAME AUDIENCE I SELL TO. And I did all the search engine optimization myself. I don't pretend to be an SEO guru. In fact, I hate technology, but I realized some time ago that your rankings in Google searches are too valuable to entrust to others. There's no need to spend a fortune with SEO companies when you can achieve astounding results yourself - without any technical expertise. After all, no-one knows your business like you do, and no one can be as highly motivated.Does it work?These are the results of some of my key phrase Google rankings (PS I am a copywriter)IT Copywriter - position number one out of over 13 million competing sitesBrochure Copywriter - top position out of 375,000 competing sitesWhite Paper Copywriter - number one out of 233,000 sitesLogistics Copywriter - top out of half a million siteCopy and PasteIn this search engine optimization training course, there's no sales hype. I just lift the kimono and show you exactly what I did to my own site – and you can do exactly the same to your site – just 'copy and paste'. And, yes, it does take into account the latest changes that Google has made to its ranking algorithm.A jargon-free zoneWe start very gently, taking a bite at a time. In the entire course there are just six hard-core jargon words (I couldn't avoid those). They are search engine optimization basics, so they are easy to understand. The rest is pure layman's language. Each video introduces a new concept and is followed by a downloadable pdf, so you have a hard copy and can add notes of your own.Oh – and I am very accessible. Any queries, or anything not clear, just email me.I am here to help.WARNING: If you are already proficient at SEO, this course is NOT for you. It's not for 'techies', so you will be disappointed and frustrated. It is intended for people like me, too occupied running my business to want to get down to the minutia. I just want top ratings – and that's what I get.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/12196_c290_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/search-engine-optimization-made-easy/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","SEO"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":531,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376a5f60-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376fdda0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"seo-beginners-how-i-get-1-000-visitors-a-day-with-seo"},{"id":"376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"11331","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.177Z","updated":"2017-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"SEO Training Course by Moz","headline":"Learn SEO tips and tricks in this SEO training course from Moz","description":" SEO is the active practice of optimizing a web site by improving internal and external aspects in order to increase the traffic the site receives from search engines. Firms that practice SEO can vary; some have a highly specialized focus, while others take a more broad and general approach. Optimizing a web site for search engines can require looking at so many unique elements that many practitioners of SEO (SEOs) consider themselves to be in the broad field of website optimization (since so many of those elements intertwine).

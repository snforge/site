Medical terms generally are comprised of a family of prefixes, suffixes, and root words that combine in multiple ways to form the language of medical terminology. A student who understands the meanings of these terms can typically “translate” any basic medical term to derive its meaning. This is a basic course covering the fundamentals of medical terminology used in the science and health science fields. It is ideal for any student who has little or no background in medical terminology, but who requires a basic grasp of the subject in order to communicate with nurses, physician’s assistants, physicians, and other medical professionals. It is also ideal as a review course for persons returning to school or the workplace after a prolonged absence. The terminology covered relates to bodily systems, anatomical structures, medical diagnoses and procedures.

Many times the publishers offer you a huge amount of material, but sadly without specific structure related to the important german medical language exam. With this course I want to help you having success with the german language and passing the so called Fachsprachprüfung to be able to practice medicine in germany.The course gives you a comprehensive amount of material, specific for each chapter of the medical language test in germany. The videos show you how to communicate with patients, how to translate and intonate labvalues, and how to write doctor letters. The letters are adjusted and made by doctors, working in germany since years. Additional to that, I took from multiple clinics in germany the medical administration dokuments, adjusted and combined them to one big dokument. The complete course has audio. This way you can read, write and hear in the same time.I hope the course helps you with studying more efficiantly and more successfully.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746916_e231_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/german-for-doctors/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Language","German Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37738729-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37747182-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733901-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"deutsch-fuer-mediziner-german-for-doctors"},{"id":"3776e280-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28195","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.945Z","updated":"2013-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Mixing Electronic Music with Logic Pro","headline":"Learn everything you need to know about mixing electronic music with Logic Pro - Includes project stems to download","description":" So you're a producer, DJ or an aspiring musician...?

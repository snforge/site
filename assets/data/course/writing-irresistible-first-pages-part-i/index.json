Yet, traditional publishers are increasingly choosy about the authors with whom they work. At the same time, a dramatic increase in the number and quality of tools available to would-be authors has caused even many established authors to eschew traditional publishers and do things by themselves--often for much higher royalties. But you don't want your book to look, well, amateurish. What to do? In this twelve-part course, eight-time author, speaker, and publisher Phil Simon lets you in on secrets on how to professionally publish your own book. He addresses each step in the publishing process, offering his first-hand input and insider advice. He offers crucial comments on subsidy presses that claim to have authors' interests at heart and explains the different options available to you. Phil has been down this road more than a few times. After doing two books with traditional publishers, he started Motion Publishing to produce his next two books—and publish four others. (He then returned to traditional publishing books number five, six, seven, and eight.) In short, he knows where the bodies are buried. Learn valuable tips and avoid critical mistakes that can cost you a great deal of time, money, and peace of mind.

There are a lot of great reasons to use online content to market your business - you can attract more traffic, establish your expertise and earn the trust that turns your website's visitors into customers. Heck, even Google changed their search engine so that sites with great content float to the top of their search results pages. However, creating content can be challenging. It takes time. Not everyone enjoys writing and many folks just don't like to write at all. Writing content for website means trouble to them! But what if there was a way to quickly and easily create the kind of content that attracts your target customers? What if you could use that content to build so much credibility, authority and trust that potential customers are driven to take action by buying your products and services, following you on social media sites and signing-up to get your newsletters? And, what if doing this was easier than what you're trying to do now? It's all possible with content curation. Content curation doesn't do away with the writing, but it does make web content writing easier to quickly create powerful content that will: ● Bring more traffic to your site ● Increase the number of your social media fans and followers ● Build your e-mail marketing list ● Establish you as a top \"go-to\" expert in your industry ● Keep you on top of your target customer's mind ● Earn you good karma (and \"social credit\") from your peers ● Increase sales What's that? You think content curation is the lazy man's way to do inbound marketing? Well, if you just listed a bunch of links, I would say that you're right. But content curation is much more than that. Content curation is all about adding value to the links you curate and this course teaches you -- using step-by-step videos, worksheets and templates -- how to do just that. The course is split into four parts: 1 Content curation overview and examples: teaches you what content curation is, why you should use it and how you can use it; 2 Creating content curated content: how to choose topics to curate, how to find and select content for each topic, how to add value to the content you find and how to construct the actual content; 3 Content curation tips-and-tricks: a couple of handy lessons on extending the value of content curation; and 4 Putting content curation into action: how to get started using content curation to start writing website content and blow up your business. But wait, there's more! I've also included a bonus video that teaches you all about inbound marketing and a content curated document which is all about content curation. The best thing about this course: You can use it to quickly create powerful content, content that brings customers to your site and drives them to take action, again and again and again and again and (well, you get the idea)... p.s.

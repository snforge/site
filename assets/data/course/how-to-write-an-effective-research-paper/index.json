Includes examples and a research paper template.","description":"These days, the expectation for publishing research papers has increased significantly in academia, in professional communities, and in science and technology disciplines worldwide. In scientific fields (especially in academia), both graduate students and faculty are expected to publish the results of their research work in journals and conference proceedings.  Publication of research or journal papers has also become a key measure for tenure and promotion assessments.  In fact, U.S. News, Gallop, and other external organizations often consider publications as a critical metric in their analysis and ranking of programs and institutions. Unfortunately, despite the widespread standard of writing and publishing research papers, most Universities don’t offer any formal training or mentorship on how to write effective papers.  The lack of guidance and resources has made it difficult, and at times frustrating, for graduate students and young researchers to properly organize and structure their papers for acceptance into publications. Whether you are a graduate student, conducting research, working towards a tenure, or you would like to advance your professional career in science, technology or academia, you will find this course greatly helpful.  You will no longer have to struggle or spend countless hours figuring out how to start your research paper, only to have it turn out not as good as you hoped. If you are a beginner, you can simply follow along with the easy steps outlining each section of your paper; even if you are more experienced, you may be surprised at how much you can improve your research writing technique from the strategies and examples presented in the course videos. This “Writing Research Papers: How to Write Research Paper Effectively” course will provide you with the valuable research guidance from a scholar with over 28 years of experience in research and teaching in higher education.

Using journaling to transform your life","headline":"Create lasting change through journaling, writing, reflecting and creative writing exercises. Memoir preparation","description":"OverviewWriting to heal takes you on a journey that asks you  to first pick up your pen and write in a journal.  To then reflect on what you have written and  rewrite it with positive intention, so that you change your story.As you change the way in which you view life and  your story, your life will change.  Add  in the dimension of creative  writing exercises, through short stories, prose or poems, suddenly  you are on an adventure where you are in control of your destiny.  You can now decide what happens to the  characters and what the outcome of the tale might be.Let me hold your hand and guide you the process I use with my coaching clients.Course structureWe start by looking at what journaling is and in the first few modules get you started on your journaling journey and writing each  day.There are a number of different creative writing exercises for you to use as inspiration and kick-starts.After you have got used to your daily journaling, it  is then time to start reflecting and included are a number of reflection  exercises, which are designed to help you see where your unhelpful patterns of  behaviour are and to encourage you to change thought patterns, habits, beliefs  and perceptions.Both journaling and reflecting are immensely healing  activities in themselves. I have added in creative life writing as I have  witnessed both my clients and myself getting huge benefits from melding fact  with fiction to come up with some factional stories, which put us back in the  driving seat of our lives.How long will it take?It takes as long as you would like. How you work through the material  should be in a way that suits you. You are encouraged to journal for 30 days to create a good habit.  The exercises are designed to get you thinking and for you to a) follow in a linear fashion or b)  randomly try things.Why take this course?This course is for anyone who feels 'stuck' and  would like to try a novel approach to changing their life and starting to heal.  Writing is cathartic and when you  add in reflection and creative life writing the opportunities for change and  healing open up.What else?Many people who use journalling have discovered that  they also have a book inside of them.   You may not want to publish your book, however, this course will lead  you from journaling into creative life writing and give you the confidence to  write a book if you so choose.If you can journal you can write, if you can write  short stories you can write a book.                                                                So start learning these highly creative writing exercises  to reveal your full potential. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/22643_564d_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-to-heal/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Journaling"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":69,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c5b34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea522-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d3a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"writing-to-heal-using-journaling-to-transform-your-life"},{"id":"3773ae37-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"22976","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.815Z","updated":"2012-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"A Beginners Guide To Setting Up A WordPress Blog","headline":"Learn the A to Z process of creating and setting up a wordpress blog","description":"Starting a Wordpress blog might be an amazing experience for someone new to the field.

This course teaches you how processors work and how machine code is possible. We start the course using an emulator for the legacy Intel 8086 processor.Since we start the course with an emulator it allows me to pause the machine at any moment in time and show you exactly what is going on.After you learn all about the legacy 8086 processor and how to program assembly for it we then move to the modern processors of today and start writing assembly for those. You are taught how to write 32 bit programs for Windows machine's and most importantly how to communicate with C programs using assembly language.This course recommends that you have some prior experience in the C programming language or at the very least some programming experience in another language. The reason for this is because part two of the course when I teach modern assembly I reference the C programming language quite a lot since we write assembly that can talk with C.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749466_d775_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Assembly Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d39-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course"},{"id":"3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28373","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Advanced Java Programming","headline":"Take Your Java Programming Skills To The Next Level.

Once you gain your confidence in the underlying areas, youâll be ready to complete the functional To-Do List app that is integrated into the course.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/11152_b642_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-sharp-for-beginners/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C#"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":309,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learning-c-net-programming-for-beginners"},{"id":"376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"9463","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.173Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Programming Java for Beginners - The Ultimate Java Tutorial","headline":"Learn Java Programming at your own Pace.

Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, youâll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, youâll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, youâll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

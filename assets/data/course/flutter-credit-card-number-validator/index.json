Now, you can give and receive immediate and specific answers about romance, money, and career. You can predict the future using an item found in virtually every household--an ordinary deck of playing cards. Your Future Is In The Cards: Become a Fortune Teller in 7 Days demystifies the art of fortune-telling and delivers a step-by-step system of interpreting playing cards at a professional level. This crash course teaches you everything you need to know to begin a fortune telling with playing cards and giving accurate and detailed readings in just one week. The Method This course takes an analytical approach to cartomancy which means you’ll learn to read the cards using a logical, step-by-step process. Specific meanings are assigned based on card numbers, suits and even suit colors (red or black), creating a commonsense method that is easy to apply. Each card has a basic meaning but you will find new associations for the cards as you work with them. And, as you progress, your intuition will fill in the gaps. Through your readings, you will help yourself and your clients: · Perceive the present more clearly · Understand hidden influences · Uncover blocks and obstacles · Find solutions · See how the future may unfold What You Will Learn in this Course First, you get the basics, which means understanding the parts of a standard playing card deck, guidelines for cartomancers, and learning to shuffle and select cards. Next, you’ll learn what each card represents. Then, you’ll discover new techniques to gain more information from the cards to add important details to your readings in this playing card reading course. Masterfully, you will learn to pull precise details from the cards revealing physical descriptions (“Your future romantic partner has a dark complexion--perhaps of African American, Latin, East Indian, heritage. He’s stocky in build and he has facial hair”), and timing of events (“A job offer will be presented in the 2nd week of spring”).

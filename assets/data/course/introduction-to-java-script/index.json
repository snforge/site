Frameworks can be very intimidating and nobody wants to spend a long time setting up a local development environment just to spin up a basic application.Vue is a progressive framework and that might sound like a bunch of marketing jargon to you but I promise you it isn't. This means that you can get started using Vue quickly and easily and as your needs grow the framework will grow with you.To get started with Vue all you need to do is drop a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. This allows you to add Vue to your existing applications without having to buy into complicated toolchains. In this course, all of the examples that we walkthrough can be done by adding Vue to a single HTML file and writing a little bit of JavaScript.If you're a front end web developer that has a working knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript this course is for you. If you just want to learn the basics of Vue in a couple of hours, this course is for you. This course isn't meant to teach everything you need to know about Vue. It will teach you the fundamental building blocks of Vue and it will do so in under two hours.You will learn how to build Vue applications through a series of tutorials, exercises and quizzes meant to reinforce the concepts you learn in this course. You will have access to all of the starting code so that you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate and can focus in on the task at hand. You will also have access to all of the solutions in case you get stuck.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746764_7fa1_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Web Development","Vue JS"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b22b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a75-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd063-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"vue-js-2-essential-basics-for-beginners-vue-js"},{"id":"3775d118-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"26845","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.939Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Advanced HTML5 Tutorial for Web Developers","headline":"Take Your HTML5 Skills To The Next Level.

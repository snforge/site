Starting with a basic introduction to the fundamental photography concepts of ISO, Depth of Field and Shutter Speed, you will quickly discover that this video tutorial covers more than correcting red-eye, although it does that too, but it also is rife with techniques that photographers can use both in Photoshop, and before you even take the picture with your camera. When combined with the Photoshop for Beginners tutorial course, you will have an impressive range of knowledge of the program and a specific expertise when it comes to working with photos after learning these Photoshop Actions for Photographers.

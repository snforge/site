These powerful techniques are often used in applied machine learning to achieve the best overall performance.In this unique course, after installing the necessary tools you will jump straight into the bagging method so as to get the best results from algorithms that are highly sensitive to specific data—for example, algorithms based on decision trees. Next, you will discover another powerful and popular class of ensemble methods called boosting. Here you'll achieve maximal algorithm performance by training a sequence of models, where each given model improves the results of the previous one. You will then explore a much simpler technique called voting, where results from multiple models are achieved using simple statistics such as the mean average. You will also work hands-on with algorithms such as stacking and XGBoost to improve performance.By the end of this course, you will know how to use a variety of ensemble algorithms in the real world to boost your machine learning models.Please note that a working knowledge of Python 3; the ability to run simple commands in Shell (Terminal); and also some basic machine learning experience are core prerequisites for taking and getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and programmed professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share this with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups, he was involved in. He failed miserably then. He then discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning, which he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to the “Keep it simple” mantra. He is the author of multiple bestselling video courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Real-World Deep Learning Python Projects and AI in Finance.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742004_65b9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769462-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python"},{"id":"3778de55-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2747110","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.092Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Rhino Grasshopper Architectural Space-frame with Connections","headline":"Creating an Architectural Space-frame with connections and outer skin","description":"Are you interested in Grasshopper and want to learn how it works?

No prior knowledge of C++ is assumed. The course is based on the excellent textbook Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. Like the textbook, the course quickly dives into problem solving and making use of the C++ standard library, including strings, vectors, and lists. The emphasis is on teaching you the parts of C++ that you will most likely need in your day-to-day programming. This course is Part 1 of a planned two-part sequence. Part 1 covers the first seven chapters of Accelerated C++, in particular, Chapters 0 through 6. The course consists of six videos of 50-60 minutes each. Part 2 of the course, forthcoming, will cover the second half of Accelerated C++, including how to write your own classes and generic functions.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/17503_7fa8_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-short-and-sweet/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C++"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":1391,"isFree":true,"matches":["376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"c-short-and-sweet-part-1"},{"id":"376c5b31-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"9513","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.173Z","updated":"2011-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Learning Autodesk AutoCAD - Crash Course","headline":"Autocad - Crash Course is for people looking to get a handle on this powerful software in a short amount of time.","description":"Learning AutoCAD is a course I wrote for people looking to get a handle on this powerful software in a short amount of time.  By the end of the course, you'll be comfortable with how to work with drawing files, controlling the views, creating basic geometry, editing, and creating text to accompany your work. *Over 3 hours of video lectures. A great benefit of this course is the pause button; you're able to stop the video and try out the commands, continuing when you're ready.  Let your curiosity lead you through the course, and try to apply it to the type of work you're expecting to use the software for.

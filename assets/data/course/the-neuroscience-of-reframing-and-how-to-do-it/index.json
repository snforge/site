Anette Prehn's non-technical approach, together with her clear explanations, made this course a joy to follow.\" \"Truly helpful\" \"This woman must be a saint. She gives away so much here that I'm left in utter gratitude.\" \"This should have been taught in school at a young age\" \"WOW!\" More than 800 course participants have reviewed this course over the years. More than 60% give it a straight 5 out of 5 stars, ensuring it an impressive 4.5 out of 5 in total. Will you be the next one to benefit from this free course? Reframing should be in the water we drink, scientists say. Reframing is the ability to change your perspective deliberately. But why is it praised like that? What happens in the brain when you reframe? What are the inner and outer effects? And how do you do it? You are invited to share your most powerful reframings - either as a comment to the group or by contacting Anette Prehn at anette@anetteprehn.com This course is targeted for professionals, managers and executives which will show in the examples given and the questions asked. However, anyone is free to join so that as many as possible may harvest the benefits of reframing.

It caresses and comforts us, provides sustenance and refreshment, is something that humanity has cherished since the beginning of history, and means something different to everyone else. Yet the historical facts and information about water remains little known. Water tells the story of changing human relationships with water over the past 10,000 years and tries to answer some basic questions: How have human attitudes to water changed since people first began to manage their water supplies? What major events in the past have defined our present relationship to water, not as something revered, but treated as an anonymous commodity? Why are we now facing a global water crisis and what are prospects for the future? This is the story of gravity and human ingenuity, of irrigation and aqueducts, of humble farming villages, ancient cities, and the rise and fall of civilizations. We draw on archaeology and hydrology, on anthropology and ancient oral traditions, on classical literature and Islamic agriculture—on a broad array of scientific inquiries in many languages and in all parts of the world. Taking this course will make you look at water in an entirely new way.

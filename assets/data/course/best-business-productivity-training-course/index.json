No work at home opportunity can compete with the Master Copywriter.","description":"Why Copywriters are the Smartest People Online Not long ago everyone wanted to work at home because of the “pajama draw”. The idea of getting up when you want to, working in your pajamas and avoiding the traffic jams does have its appeal. Nowadays people are working online for the large income opportunities that far outweigh a limited global job market. Many fail…sad… The reason they fail is blatantly obvious; their sales copy was either written by them or someone that has no idea what they are doing. Those that succeed use professional copywriters. Words matter! Whether it is a simple email campaign or a 6 page sales funnel, copy sells… not the product. The online marketing world is a gold rush.  One thing always stays the same, in any gold rush, boom, bubble, secular ascent, whatever you want to call it, there comes a point where an inordinate amount of money begins flowing towards those selling the shovels, no matter if the diggers are getting rich or not. Copywriters are selling shovels. Two Reasons to become a Copywriter  1.)    You want to be among the top internet entrepreneurs - not counted among the mass of failures.  2.)    The absurd amount of money copywriters make causes you to drool.

Over 75,000 students CURRENTLY enrolled! So, you might ask - what's the fuss all about? Well, there are two reasons people seem to like it: 1. Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) 2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively. You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. Why? How? Really? Yes, and it's all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) So, do you ever ask yourself, \"I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?\" Let's face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You've got a copy of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' on your bookshelf, you know it's a great book yet you haven't opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you've not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you're still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It's pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don't have an iron will. I don't even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I'm honest. Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn't really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just 'have more self-discipline', just 'get better'. That's why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn't even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. So, you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So, instead of increasing our willpower, let's use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We're still going to have to do the work, it's just that we won't have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I'm not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We're afraid that we won't stick at things because that's what we've done in the past. We're afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we'd rather not try. We're afraid we're not good enough. We're afraid we don't have enough willpower. We're not afraid of doing the work, we're afraid that our work won't work! So, the big question is what's going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you're ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... ________________ Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and 'Thought Engineer', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. The system takes 'One thing at a time' to a new level: it's monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you've ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! It's basically the shizzle is what I'm saying...

The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"37789031-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2746136","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.048Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"TikTok Beginner's Master Course To Grow Followers 2020","headline":"How to use TikTok, gain a community of loyal followers, become TikTok famous and how to use it as a business for growth","description":"Why me?I have worked with Fortune 500 brands such as Adidas, L’Oreal, Danone and Pfizer on multiple digital marketing projects.

Your old-school promotion isn’t producing results, which doesn’t surprise you since you just read in the Harvard Business Review that traditional marketing is dead. And that’s not really news either, because you keep hearing about how people are trusting traditional advertising less and less and trusting peer/social recommendations more and more. You’ve tried growing your business with \"the aggregators,\" but a lot of those leads are low quality, all of them are \"cold\" by nature, and the prices for those services just keep going up. Size of Sphere = Size of Income? So, you find yourself in this place where you’ve maxed out your sphere of influence using traditional methods. And anyone who’s been in real estate longer than 5 minutes knows that the size of your sphere determines the size of your income. More connections = more money, right? New Life for Your Business And you think, “Those old, cold and expensive methods just aren’t working for me. I need to find a new way to expand my network and inject new life into my business.” And so, for all those reasons, you decide to give Twitter a try. And here’s what you discover: That Twitter users are the most active and dynamic in all of Social Media  That you can use keywords and laser-focused geo-targeting to connect with people right in your community That there’s not a lot of competition, because most people do the wrong things, get no results and blame Twitter for the lackluster ROI - when in reality the problem wasn't Twitter at all, but simply those people doing the wrong things That Twitter is exploding, and there are now nearly HALF A BILLION people using the platform Grow Your Network So, you start connecting with more and more people, growing your network every single day. You quickly realize that Twitter users love to engage and make new connections. And you discover a few things that you did not expect. That the learning curve is not that steep. And that Twitter is actually fun. Yes, FUN! You nurture along hundreds of relationships, building and building a little bit more each and every week. And you wake up one day and realize that you’ve expanded your network dramatically while doing 99% of it at home in front of your computer. Or from your smart phone or you iPad. And you realize that what you heard was actually true: that Twitter really is the greatest relationship creation machine of all time. And you think, \"I only wish I had started using Twitter sooner.\" Take this course and let me show you how to grow your sphere of influence using Twitter....

If you purchase this course and feel even a smidgen of disappointment, Udemy will give you your money back, so long as it's within the first 30 days, no questions asked.

This course will concentrate on Technical Analysis, and you will learn everything I know about correctly reading stock charts in about 80 minutes!  By training yourself to read and correctly interpret the information charts give you, you will be able to predict which way a stock will most likely move in the near future.  Charts can actually give you a glimpse of the future, and are a must have tool in the successful trader's arsenal.In my Beginners Guide to Technical Analysis of Stock Charts here on Udemy, I covered fifty different technical indicators.  In this course, I teach the one indicator I use for all of my Buy and Sell Signals, and it's accuracy rate is about 80%. Two of the most important lessons included in this course are how to handle a false Buy Signal to keep losses to an absolute minimum, and when to lock in profits to maximize your gains. The trading strategy I teach in this course will provide you with a plan for entering and exiting trades with confidence. I look forward to helping you to become a successful Trader!Happy Trading! Tom  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2762_231c_20.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/swing-trading-the-stock-market/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Finance","Swing Trading"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":349,"isFree":false,"matches":["37722790-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab310-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b0a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb77-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37797a91-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37790564-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769468-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"simple-strategy-for-swing-trading-the-stock-market"}]}}

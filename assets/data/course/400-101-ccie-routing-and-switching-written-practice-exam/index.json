I cover BGP thoroughly in both my CCNP ROUTE and TSHOOT courses here on Udemy and on my DVDs, and I've created this separate course for those who don't want the full $97 course, but who need the help with BGP. Every single lesson from those courses are right here - over four full hours of in-depth BGP study! Thanks for enrolling, and for making The Bryant Advantage part of your CCNP success story!

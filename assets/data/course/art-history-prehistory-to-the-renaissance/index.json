This course provides an understanding of the origins of services and service management theory, the core terms, principles and concepts found in Universal Service Management, the elements of a service management framework, including the operational system, and key roles within a service provider organization, workforce management system, and consumer management system. The course includes an introduction to “Outside-In\" (customer-centric) thinking, and its relationship to decisions on what products and services to offer, the makeup of those services, and the service support designed to manage the customer interactions, touchpoints, and customer service experience based upon 'moments of truth'. The course also describes the relationship between service functionality and successful customer outcomes, the principles of measuring and managing the customer's level of satisfaction with the service experience, and how these form the basis for defining problems, and responding to these through a continuous improvement program embedded within the service excellence system component of the service management framework.The Universal Service Management Body of Knowledge (USMBOK) is a series of reference publication used by professionals within a service provider organization or service business to design a systematic method for managing services.The USMBOK is a proud member of the International Best Practice Library, alongside the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge), and ITIL® (IT Infrastructure Library).","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/28951_0d50_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-usmbok-foundation-accelerator/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Operations","Management Skills"],"rating":2.4,"reviews":2,"isFree":false,"matches":["37716449-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e5701-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720086-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716443-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b745-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab314-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b266-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"service-management-fundamentals-also-usmboktm-foundation"},{"id":"3776e288-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28636","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.945Z","updated":"2015-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Art History Renaissance to 20th Century","headline":"A basic level survey of painting, sculpture, and architecture.","description":"This is part one of a year-long college-level survey course in art history.

We explore modern methods of natural light photography","description":"There is something inherently beautiful about natural light. It can be soft and warm, or hard and unforgiving, or even have a sort of melancholy to it. These are the areas we will be looking at in this course.Fashion and Beauty photography make use of natural light in many ways. A recent viewing of Vogue (October, 2012) reveals many natural light photography shots by up and coming and well established photographers. The techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting.We will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light. We will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. These tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding.The natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. There is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos.Most lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a Photoshop tutorial, the PSD file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. Looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool.If you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images. The beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. I recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. A couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal.This class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in May 2013 and June 2013.

In this course you can find lectures, video demonstrations and PDFs that will help further the information provided in each session. You may be able to complete the lectures in a 1 week time period but I would encourage going back over the material as many times as you like until you have mastered the information provided. Plus, there will be ongoing discussions between students and myself to help build the independent animation, game and film communities. This course is structured in sessions that consist of lectures. The students will need to watch or listen to the lectures provided and work alongside the demonstrations to help them follow the information provided. You will in some sessions be asked to read PDF materials provided in the sessions. Considering the possibility of a high volume of students, I will try my best to answer most of the questions and give feedback when I host live sessions. I also plan on scheduling live sessions with industry professionals so that you get a clearer understanding of the techniques used here. By taking this course in Intro to Storyboarding, you will gain the foundations of a visual storyteller. The goal here is to insure that the people who sign up will learn to use industry methods to further enhance the stories they would like to tell. I would like to help create new storyboard artists for filmmaking, game design, photography for narratives, and graphic design by adding some proven creative storytelling skills to their visual work.

After that we look in detail how Herodotus presents the beginning of the great conflict between Greece and Persian, and finish up with an overview of the various Greek philosophers. If you're taking a class in Greek culture somewhere and need a little help, or if you are a motivated autodidact, I'm sure you'll find these lectures a good step forward in your understanding and appreciation of the world of the Greeks.

It caresses and comforts us, provides sustenance and refreshment, is something that humanity has cherished since the beginning of history, and means something different to everyone else. Yet the historical facts and information about water remains little known. Water tells the story of changing human relationships with water over the past 10,000 years and tries to answer some basic questions: How have human attitudes to water changed since people first began to manage their water supplies? What major events in the past have defined our present relationship to water, not as something revered, but treated as an anonymous commodity? Why are we now facing a global water crisis and what are prospects for the future? This is the story of gravity and human ingenuity, of irrigation and aqueducts, of humble farming villages, ancient cities, and the rise and fall of civilizations. We draw on archaeology and hydrology, on anthropology and ancient oral traditions, on classical literature and Islamic agriculture—on a broad array of scientific inquiries in many languages and in all parts of the world. Taking this course will make you look at water in an entirely new way.

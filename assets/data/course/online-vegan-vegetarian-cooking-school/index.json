If you practise these videos, you should feel results of calm and clarity along with highly increased energy while experiencing stress reduction. Yoga with Perumal is made up of 6 parts that act as an underlying fixed foundation. The 6 parts of Yoga with Perumal are pranayama, preparatory, salutation, strength, stretching and meditation. Each part follows a particular order to act as synergistic to the other. Whether you are taking Course 1, 2, or 3 of the series, each course includes a combinaton of these six parts for your total training. The most important aspect of Yoga with Perumal is the ability to grow progressively from yoga forms and a sequence that may be followed at one’s own pace from beginner through advanced. Again, please go at your own pace! Each video lecture is designed to give you the most comprehensive view of each pose since I provide 3 different camera angles for all asana (postures) to show you a lateral, frontal, and overhead perspective. Each video also has supportive text to reveal any hidden aspects of yoga and is accompanied by a supportive manual for total understanding of each pose.  In this course, you will find:  the complete Course Series 2, which includes 4 long progressive lessons named 2A - 2D. the complete Short Series on Pranayama, Preparatory, Saluation and Stretching. amazingly detailed manuals for both Course 2A - 2D and of the Short series to provide additional information on the video lessons. The Course Series 2 is a step-by-step development form that progresses from least challenging to most dynamic postures. Course 2A - 2D videos areapproximately 45 - 60 minutes in length so if you only have 5-25 minutes of practise time, work with the Short Series. It is always best to start at the beginning of each Short Series before going to the higher levels.  Once you have mastered Course 1 & 2, I hope you will continue your practice with the final course series on Course 3, and continue mastering the Short Series that is found in each of the different courses.  Thank you for your interest in Yoga with Perumal and I hope you enjoy the series!    ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20321_8e78_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/yoga-with-perumal-course-series-2/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":5,"reviews":2,"isFree":false,"matches":["3772279a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711620-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"authentic-yoga-experience-series-2"},{"id":"3772279a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"20320","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.698Z","updated":"2018-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Authentic Yoga Experience Series 1","headline":"Immerse Yourself, FROM SCRATCH, into the most authentic Yoga Experience","description":"Course 1 is the 1st part of a 3 Part Series.

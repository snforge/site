Consequently, container orchestration has become a critical piece of infrastructure for enterprises on their digital transformation journey. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration.This course provides a tour of how to debug issues with the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure and presents a working conceptual model of how clusters operate. You will be addressing common problems faced by developers in cluster management, monitoring, and logging. Subsequently, we examine common issues when creating and deploying apps on Kubernetes.By the end of the course, you'll have gained full control of your Kubernetes infrastructure and will be able to manage it with ease.Please note a working knowledge of Kubernetes is required for this course.About the AuthorPradipta Kumar BanerjeeIBM, Senior Technical Staff Member, Bangalore, IndiaPradipta is a Senior Technical Staff Member for the IBM Cloud Private platform and leads cloud-native platform initiatives for IBM Power Microprocessor.

Spring Boot 2.x, a feature-rich platform built from the Spring 5.x framework, is created by to help developers solve their complex problems with fewer configurations but with strong dependency management features.In this course, you will learn how to create various modules in a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) such as employee timesheets, leave management, and profiling. You will use Spring Boot 2.x to create your HRIS app while integrating Spring Web MVC, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data, RESTful web services, and clients. Above all, you'll use the latest version of Spring Security—5.0—to secure your apps and OAuth 2.x to implement an OpenID connection. You'll apply reactive programming with its Spring Web Flux and Project Reactor features. Finally, you will deploy your apps and services using some popular cloud and container platforms such as Spring Cloud Foundry, Docker, and AWS.By the end of the course, you will be confident in implementing the core features of Spring Boot 2.x to create scalable, optimal, and robust enterprise web applications.About the AuthorSherwin John Calleja Tragura started his career as a Java developer by focusing on the Documentum and Alfresco document management systems.

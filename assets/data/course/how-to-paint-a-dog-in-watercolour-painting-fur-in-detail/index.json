At 8 months Tyson started barking and lunging at people, at 10 months he became leash reactive towards dogs, by 1 year he had full out aggression towards puppies. When Julie realized that she had not learned proper techniques to deal with aggression – punishing Tyson for his behaviour made him lash out with greater intensity, she started looking for new ways to help her dog. Clicker training brought a new light to Tyson’s aggression and gave Julie a skill-set to manage his behaviour. This inspired Julie to learn about positive reinforcement training and set her on the path to becoming a professional positive reinforcement dog trainer.Julie is a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) through the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT). As the owner of a successful dog walking company in Toronto, Julie sharpens her training skills daily when she is out on her group walks. When she’s not dog walking you can find her teaching tricks to her own dogs.Both her dogs have titles in Rally Obedience and Freestyle but her greatest accomplishment is being able to bring her Puggle out with her on group walks. Treatpouch.com is her way of sharing with the world both the power of positive reinforcement training and the joy that comes from working with your dog.Julie is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Animal Behavior, at Memorial University, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.Andre YeuAndre’s passion for dog training began when he rescued his beagle, Duke, who suffered from on-leash reactivity and dog-aggression. Andre quickly discovered clicker training and the power of positive reinforcement, and through patience and care was able to help Duke overcome his fear and dislike of other dogs.Duke’s success gave Andre the confidence to volunteer and foster with a number of animal rescue organizations in the city. While each foster dog presented new challenges every dog could be helped through clicker training.In 2009, Andre decided to open When Hounds Fly! in Downtown Toronto, to make positive reinforcement training convenient and accessible to members of the community, and to improve the quality of life for dogs and dog owners in the downtown core. With the success of his school and the transformation he’s seen in the neighbourhood dogs, Andre decided that it would be a worthy cause to offer people the benefits of positive reinforcement based training regardless of where they live. Through Treatpouch.com Andre hopes to improve the lives of dogs and their people all over the world.Andre is a Karen Pryor Academy Certified Training Partner (KPA CTP), a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA), and a Truly Dog-Friendly Trainer. He grew up in Vancouver, has a bachelor’s degree in commerce, with honors, from the University of British Columbia, and lives in Toronto with his partner, Hyedie Hashimoto, and their rescue beagles, Duke and Petey.\n","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18719_2257_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/politepuppy/","language":"en","tags":["Lifestyle","Pet Care & Training","Dog Training"],"rating":3.8,"reviews":68,"isFree":false,"matches":["376a3850-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776e286-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738724-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd065-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376be600-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711626-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b260-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"polite-puppy-dog-training-class"},{"id":"37711623-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17648","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.688Z","updated":"2016-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Oil/Acrylic Painting Techniques and Color Theory","headline":"These oil and acrylic painting lessons follow step by step procedures for painting techniques and color theory","description":" This painting lesson covers oil/ acrylic painting techniques and color theory.

No references.","description":"Discover the 7 Secrets of Figure Drawing: Draw Awesome Figuresin Two Weeks  Ever feel so frustrated with your figure drawings you justwant to give up? Is it even hard to draw a cartoon? You see other artists’ work and think, why can’t I draw myfigures like that? I used to feel the same way until I discovered the secretsof figure drawing, and I’m going to share them with you. Tim thought he would never be a concept artist because his figuredrawings weren’t good enough, but then he found my 10 hour course, and guess what?He’s now a concept artist. You too can draw the human figure like a master artist.  “I want to help Neil because he helped me. I owe my job tohim. His teaching techniques and teaching style made everything finally click.I just got it! I started drawing figures that looked good. What a greatfeeling. Even if I never landed my dream career, just the feeling of drawinggreat figures was worth every penny Neil charges. I can’t believe he offers somuch for so little.” – Tim.  Don’t give up on yourself. You can draw people, and youwon’t believe how little it will cost you. You want to draw for a living, or paint for a living, butthe human figure is holding you back, but it doesn’t have to anymore. After yougo through 10 hours of video containing my step-by-step drawing lessons and mybest-kept secrets, you’ll draw the human figure like never before! Guaranteed.I mean that. I can guarantee it because I’ve seen it work again and againfor my students.  You should see Kim’s before and after, but I don’t know howto post that here.  It worked for me. You should see how my figures used to look.I almost gave up! Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked, I madequick leaps. Would you believe that before and after was only 30 days after Ifigured the secrets of figure drawing out? Yes. It’s true. It only takes sometwo weeks. I want to repeat that because it’s so awesome. You can learn how to draw the human figure in two weeks! What? Crazy, right? My students are evidence. I am evidence.I’ve seen it work for me and others. You just have to watch the videos and do the exercises.That’s it. You can have that dream job, drawing or painting. You can make moneywith your art. You can, you can, you can. But you’ve tried art courses? You read some figure drawingbooks? You even paid for personal art lessons? Why will my course be any different?  Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tellyou how important it is to master the stick figure before you even startdrawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most masterartists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level. They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learningprocess that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro.That is what this course does for you. It turns you into a figure drawing professional. I guarantee you will finally be happy with your figuredrawings once you complete Master the Human Figure that I will give your moneyback if you aren’t. Of the 1,297 people that have bought the course so far, notone of them has complained. Not one. But you won’t ever be able to draw the human figure?  If you can master the basic stick figure, you can draw thehuman figure.  It’s true. Students have told me I should charge $500 for this 10 hourcourse Master the Human Figure. I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69dollars. What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me. But why? Why would I do that? Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, nooffice rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instantstreaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them.  “I had spent a lot ofmoney previously on books and classes however what i have learned from bothyour Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and ireally enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance ofpractice, practice, practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excitedand motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable, THANK YOU...”–OrlandoPiedrahita, CA Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 toproduce a new, flat-screen TV, and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m notgoing to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it. Why do my students believe I should charge $500?  Because you get 10 hours of video lessons. You watch over myshoulder as I draw and teach you as if you were right there with me. You aregetting 10 hours of personal teaching. Just look at all thelessons. In the fast-pacedworld of professional concept art, you must learn to draw quickly.

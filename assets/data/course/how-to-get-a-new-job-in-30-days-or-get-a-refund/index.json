Some even at places like IBM. Stop trying to figure all this stuff out on your own, let me show you step by step, how to find and secure a better job! My mission is simple… I will teach you how get a new job within 30 days of purchasing this course. Or get your money back. Don't believe me? Here's what people are saying about this course: \"I got THREE job offers after taking this course\" - Elizabeth Arata McLean \"Andrew is just an amazing guy, he is very engaged and honest. The lessons are well prepared and I enjoyed the way he explains things\" - Carlos Becerra \"The Holy Grail of Job Interview - Just got the offer, thanks Andrew! I got the job and position I dreamed of for years\" - Jae Vernon Aquino \"I'm an HR professional, have hired hundreds of people over the years and think this is one of the most clear and informative pieces I've seen on the topic\" - Susan Olsen So let's start with the facts... FACT #1 - It's still a crappy economy out there and good jobs are hard to come by. FACT #2 - There is a huge amount of competition for the jobs that do come up. FACT #3 - You're sick of applying for job after job, without hearing anything back FACT #4 - You're fed up with people saying things like “It's not what you know, it's who you know\" FACT #5 - You know you want a new job, but you feel bad for not “figuring it out\" yet Over the last five years I have been working in and around this small, yet critical area of career development. I've worked with long term unemployed people, I've interviewed recruitment managers and specialists, I've coached and mentored corporate managers and I've seen pretty much everything there is to see on both sides of the interview desk. I've even published a book on the subject of Military personnel make the transition to civilian life! Over this time, I have seen thousands of Resumes/CV's, I've observed the major mistakes that bright, intelligent people make in interviews, I've trained countless corporate managers on the selection and filtering process for candidates and now, in one place, I've created a system that you can easily follow to get you a new job in 30 days - or your money back. Bold claim huh! So what's inside this course? In this course you will: Follow a system where you take advantage of the hidden job marketCreate a killer Resume/CV and cover letter that will WOW the employerPrepare for the job interview in systematic way, that will beat the competition almost every timePrepare for your interviews with 10 different mock interviewsDevelop an ability to handle the most difficult job interview questions with easeLearn how to negotiate salary/pay related questions in a cool, non sucky wayBoost your confidence and communication skills for every application you go forLand a new job in 30 days (or your money back).

Let me convince you to purchase this course in person. Here is a recent review from 25th June 2015 by Elizabeth: \"I was under qualified for the job - but got the offer anyway! This course helped me to prepare for the question that would be asked and how I should answer them. Andrew doesn't provide the answers, that info comes from your own experience. For me this was more about the body language and tone of confidence that interviewers are looking for. I have told so many people about this course. I got three job offers after taking this course! I actually enjoy the interview process now instead of being nervous! Thank you Andrew this course exceeded my expectations!\" ..........................................................................................................................................

Side note: Our video editor, just doing some fact checking while publishing this course for us, ended up making over $200 by following one lead. It’s just that easy... EJ Thornton & John Clark Craig have written dozens of books between them and helped hundreds of authors realize their dreams. After teaching those authors how to capitalize on the income streams that are generated from having a book project, they realized that you don’t have to have a book project to capitalize on this money. You just have to have an idea. Using their real-life experience as a case study, they demonstrate how quickly and easily anyone can start creating their own new paychecks. They then ask you to compare your life experiences with their’s, so that you realize how much you have to offer this world. Then they give you the tools to start mining your own money.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23231_d2d4_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-bring-the-right-business-ideas-to-life/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Home Business","Business Idea Generation"],"rating":4.8,"reviews":18,"isFree":false,"matches":["377a64f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720085-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769468-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749896-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-bring-the-right-business-ideas-to-life"},{"id":"377052d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17035","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.597Z","updated":"2014-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Cold Call 101: How to Cold Call like a Boss","headline":"Learn the secret cold calling techniques and systems for getting anyone on the phone and getting new business, today!","description":" Cold calling and talking to a stranger is the hardest thing anyone can do.

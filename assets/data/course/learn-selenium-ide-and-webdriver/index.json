Our video tutorials will bring you right into the world of PLC explaining what you need to know to understand the fundamentals. This PLC course is a step-by-step introduction to controllers, built on a everyday experience of a practicing automation experts! So What is a PLC?A programmable logic controller, also called a PLC or programmable controller, is a computer-type device used to control equipment in an industrial facility. The kinds of equipment that PLCs can control are as varied as industrial facilities themselves. Conveyor systems, food processing machinery, auto assembly lines…you name it and there’s probably a PLC out there controlling it.What is this PLC Course about? This innovative PLC online training, is addressed to all automation enthusiasts. The tutorial is based on Siemen's LOGO! 12/24 RC and Siemens S7-1200. If you are thinking about working in automation industry, you have to deal with PLCs. If you work or study, and wondering if- and how - to start your adventure with PLC, see our course! All over the world, the continuing development of industrial automation makes PLC training a good investment.What does this course teach? Provides you a complete introduction to understanting PLC logic and career building skills needed for this industry. Creating your first projects will teach you solving real world problems in practical projects you may encounter when working with PLC's. What will I learn in this course?First programs – basic instructions and challenges filmed using Siemens LOGO Training kit for visualization How to assemble a PLC device What are the uses of programmable controllers in industry and building automation How to write programs in LOGO!

Safe, healthy fish and organic vegetables with no weeds!","description":"Welcome to Aquaponic Gardening and the fascinating marriage of hydroponics (growing plants without soil) and aquaculture (growing fish in captivity).  This course is based on my book, \"Aquaponic Gardening: A Step by Step Guide to Growing Fish and Vegetables Together \" and is designed to be easy to follow, comprehensive, and fun.   Most of the lectures in this Aquaponic Tutorial are what is called a Video / Presentation Mashup at Udemy.  What that means is that you will see a video of myself or Alan (my husband and partner) talking and demonstrating on the left, and PowerPoint slides on the right with details to keep the concepts straight. But you don't need to do anything - the slides will just appear at the correct time!  At the end of this aquaponic gardening course there is a series of articles and blog posts that I've written that I think are particularly relevant to new aquaponic gardeners who are smitten with this growing technique (and I hope that is you!) and want to dive deeper.  The first article is called the \"Aquaponic Gardening Rules of Thumb\" and it is a summary list of many of the concepts, principles and ratios that are elaborated on in the course. The lectures end with some handy tracking sheets and a list of links to many of the products that are shown in the course.  Some other resources that will prove useful as you embark on your aquaponic journey are... ·  The Aquaponic Source - our company site and shopping site for all your aquaponic gardening needs ·  The Aquaponic Gardening Community - a thriving online community of gardeners just like you who help each other learn and grow ·  Aquaponic Gardening Book ·  Aquaponics Association - a wonderful resource for promoting aquaponics.  They also put on the annual Aquaponics Association Conference. If you like this course please be sure and review it here and tell your friends! Let's get growing!

We explore modern methods of natural light photography","description":"There is something inherently beautiful about natural light. It can be soft and warm, or hard and unforgiving, or even have a sort of melancholy to it. These are the areas we will be looking at in this course.Fashion and Beauty photography make use of natural light in many ways. A recent viewing of Vogue (October, 2012) reveals many natural light photography shots by up and coming and well established photographers. The techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting.We will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light. We will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. These tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding.The natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. There is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos.Most lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a Photoshop tutorial, the PSD file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. Looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool.If you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images. The beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. I recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. A couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal.This class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in May 2013 and June 2013.

This is the most complete online training in commercial photography! That’s a bold statement isn’t it? This Commercial Photography Program is designed to meet the demands photographers experience in today’s markets, but what makes this program uniquely different is that the majority of photo examples used in the program are from real photo shoots, on real assignments, and photographed for real clients. We did not just go into a studio and video tape where to put lights for all examples. Instead, we show you the photo taken in the studio or on location for a client. We show you in many cases why we chose the angle we used, where lights were placed, and any technical challenges we faced and how they were solved. This course covers everything a commercial photographer might photograph: - Portraiture - Product Photography - Architecture - Corporate and Industrial - Advertising - Fashion and Beauty - Travel - Food and Beverage - Lifestyle - Editorial - Stock and some Photoshop as well.

All you need is a dSLR camera, tripod, a few lights (see downloadable PDF on recommendations) and the passion to get started. Simply watch the intro video for examples of what is covered. Who’s the Instructor? There are many courses on how to be an amazing photographer, but how many are taught by true professionals who have a career and worked as a photographer? I was formally trained at Brooks Institute in the 1980’s and have worked every day since. I have photographed for Fortune 500 companies, been published in countless magazines (you’ve probably heard of), and photographed Hollywood actors, pro athletes, politicians, hotels, well known products, real estate, and more people, places, and things, than I can recall. I have taught photo workshops across the USA and Middle East. Founded two stock photo agencies, and sold thousands of stock photos.

The gym she goes to, saw the pictures and asked me to shoot one for an ad, which is a before and after shot of Sarah. If I hadn't taken this course, I would have never had this opportunity!

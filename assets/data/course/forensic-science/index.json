These lessons demonstrate a physical sciences perspective: training intuition by deriving equations from graphical illustrations. \"Excellent site for both basic and advanced lessons on applying mathematics to biology.\" -Tweeted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Office of Physical Sciences Oncology","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19613_d15c_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/lookatphysics/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Math","Biology"],"rating":4.1,"reviews":468,"isFree":true,"matches":["376e5704-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769463-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779c8ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa08-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb78-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dcb-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37702bc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738729-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"a-mathematical-way-to-think-about-biology"}]}}

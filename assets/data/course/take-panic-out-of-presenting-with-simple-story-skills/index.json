Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.    Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don't know all the answers.    Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.    If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23972_35ee_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-speaking-smoothly-fluently-clearly-confidently/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Communication Skills"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":572,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738727-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"improve-communication-speak-smoothly-clearly-and-confidently"},{"id":"3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23065","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.815Z","updated":"2012-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Career Mind Mastery: Interview Success Blueprint","headline":"A simple, science-based system for interview success focusing on the art of story telling and the magic of metaphors","description":" Career Mind Mastery: Learn How to Face an Interview - Your performance in the interview is all that stands between you and the role you want.

In this course you can find lectures, video demonstrations and PDFs that will help further the information provided in each session. You may be able to complete the lectures in a 1 week time period but I would encourage going back over the material as many times as you like until you have mastered the information provided. Plus, there will be ongoing discussions between students and myself to help build the independent animation, game and film communities. This course is structured in sessions that consist of lectures. The students will need to watch or listen to the lectures provided and work alongside the demonstrations to help them follow the information provided. You will in some sessions be asked to read PDF materials provided in the sessions. Considering the possibility of a high volume of students, I will try my best to answer most of the questions and give feedback when I host live sessions. I also plan on scheduling live sessions with industry professionals so that you get a clearer understanding of the techniques used here. By taking this course in Intro to Storyboarding, you will gain the foundations of a visual storyteller. The goal here is to insure that the people who sign up will learn to use industry methods to further enhance the stories they would like to tell. I would like to help create new storyboard artists for filmmaking, game design, photography for narratives, and graphic design by adding some proven creative storytelling skills to their visual work.

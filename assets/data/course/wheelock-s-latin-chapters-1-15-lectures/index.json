In them you will find guidance to some of the more perplexing concepts of grammar -- English and Latin -- that often comprise an insuperable barrier to progressing in Latin for modern-day students. The lectures will not replace the Wheelock text. They will only, I hope, make your on-ramp smoother. To that end, the lectures track exactly with the chapters of the textbook. This will give you \"context sensitive\" help when you need it.  You will not find answers to the exercises or anything that is copyright protected by the publisher of the Wheelock book. To get any benefit from these lectures, you must have the Wheelock text. A typical college-level class will cover the first 15 chapters in the first semester; a high school class will cover them in the first year.

In this course, you'll become familiar with specific book apps in different categories, and learn how these apps are pushing the boundaries of the medium. We will NOT be discussing plain text titles available on the Kindle, Nook, & other platforms. Instead we'll focus on multimedia, interactive books that are released as individual apps, such as London: A City Through Time (available in the iTunes store for iPads). In each section of the course you'll watch video demos of particular interactive book apps, read several interesting articles and discuss everything in the class forums. There is a total of about 8-10 hours of work, which you can do at your own pace, with perpetual access. We'll have discussions about the future of the book as a medium. ● What do these changes mean for readers, libraries, authors, and publishers? ● What are the qualities of a delightful reading experience? ● How are these apps enabling learning and which features and qualities enable a the best experience for readers? A resource guide is included, with links to recommended book apps, additional readings, publishers to watch and blogs to follow.

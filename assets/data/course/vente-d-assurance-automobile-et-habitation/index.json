Growing your customer base to achieve higher sales.","description":"In my Niche Marketing class you will discover how a streamlined niche marketing strategy will help you to grow your customer base who is ready to buy from you. It doesn't matter if you sell products or services.To succeed in promoting your business, it is important that you do not waste your marketing budget on unfruitful exercises. You do not want to waste your marketing efforts on the wrong people, especially those people who could not afford your product or services, or even those who would not buy your service or product anyway no matter how hard you may try.Many people mistakenly believe that marketing any type of business means having to pay for online or newspaper adverts and the buyers will come and buy. While this would be fantastic, in reality though this approach just doesn't work long time, if at all. And before you come to realise this, your marketing budget will be depleated and you will come to the realisation that your 'business has failed'.It's time to rethink your approach and accept the fact that whatever you offer, products or services, will only appeal to a defined niche market. Let's say you are selling apples, then anyone who doesn't like apples will not buy from you, even though they may have seen your advert. This is the dilemma you need to address, which is done through targeted advertising to a niche market - ultimately the market in which you operate.My niche marketing class is full of valuable tips and advice which makes it easy for everyone to develop a marketing strategy that works and which helps to grow your customer base and business as a whole.I also share with you the 5-step niche marketing method which includes:Identifying and targeting your niche marketHow to find your niche marketCollecting testimonialsHow to create niche marketing materials for your businessWays of how to contact your niche marketRemember: Niche Marketing does not need to be scary or difficult.All you need to do is to put into practice what you have learned.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20752_d801_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/expand-your-customer-base-by-narrowing-your-marketing-focus/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"niche-marketing-made-easy"},{"id":"37722797-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19958","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.698Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Winning Sales Script System for Sales and Marketing","headline":"Learn how to build a winning sales script system to close more sales, today.","description":"","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19958_c3cd_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Sales","Sales Skills"],"rating":4,"reviews":11,"isFree":false,"matches":["37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742360-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b02-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing"},{"id":"3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17158","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.602Z","updated":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Local Marketing Blue Print","headline":"Learn how to dominate your competition with local Internet Marketing","description":" This local internet marketing course is designed for 2 people.

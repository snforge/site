Companies that had a small team of just 2 Developers to companies that had 33 Developers on the team.With all these projects came a prerequisite, Interviews!Finding a new job can be challenging and intimidating some times. Frontend Technologies are evolving every day and all job requirements seem to be for someone who's no short of a genius \"someone who can hit the ground running from the very first day\". The Frontend Development terminology has evolved so much and everyone has a different definition and understanding of it nowadays. Everyone's looking for a \"Frontend Developer\" who can also perform Design, Backend, and DevOps tasks as well.Let me share my experience when it comes to interviewing for a new job. Always focus on self-education, your first few job applications should be for the job locations that you're probably not interested in. That'll help you understand the current trends/wants of a Frontend Developer job.Some job descriptions could look very intimidating and leave you wondering if you'd be the right fit for the job or not. Remember, not all job requirements come from the actual team you might join if you're selected. Some of the requirements are just Nice-to-haves or standards that are set by the company for that type of role in any team/department.Make sure you're managing your time. Don't schedule interviews for more time than you can handle in a day, that can be pretty overwhelming. The more focused and calm you're, the more you can dig into your interviews and be confident. Just in one day, I had 3 interviews that totaled in 8 hours. By the third interview, I was so burnt out that I couldn't even think of some basic answers and examples to some of the questions.During the interview, don't be afraid to ask questions at any time. It should be as important for you to understand what you're signing up for as whom they are hiring. The interviews I enjoyed the most were where I was asking a lot of questions as well and it was more like a conversation rather an interrogation. And those landed me the jobs I wanted.Speak from experiences where you can, provide real-world examples.Speak slowly and confidently, ask them to repeat themselves if you didn't catch something or understand anything. You don't have to know the answer to everything they ask, it could be something you haven't worked with yet, be honest.If you're coding live and get stuck somewhere, ask for help/hints. Most interviewers in my experience have helped me understand the requirements better or the directions I could take to overcome the mental blockage we have sometimes. It goes back to one of my previous comments, take it as a conversation/ peer programming. Work through the live coding sessions as you'd peer program/ pair code.Last but not least, enjoy the journey!This course will help you brush up on some of the fundamentals of Frontend Web Development.

LATEST: Course Updated Again for September 2015Learn EXACTLY what I've taught international brands like McDonald's and evian... in only 2 hours!Gain the skills major brands have paid hundreds of thousands for. Quickly and easily.Over 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.Have you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"I've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.It has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.I make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.When I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.I know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.Every single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.Nothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics. And you pay NOTHING EXTRA for this ongoing content.Plus, Udemy has a 30 day guarantee. And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.What this is course IS NOT:I do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.I will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.I won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.But, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.Every minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...Enroll now!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25581_4b8c_14.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/branding-public-relations-social-media-cc/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Business Branding"],"rating":3.5,"reviews":34,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-master-branding-public-relations-and-social-media"},{"id":"3774bfa4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23972","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.885Z","updated":"2018-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Improve Communication: Speak Smoothly, Clearly & Confidently","headline":"Learn How You Can Clear Interviews, Express Your Ideas, & Make Presentations Smoothly & Confidently!","description":"How to Improve Communication Skills  (Major Updates Coming Soon!)Do you struggle with getting your words out when explaining things in important situations, situations like interviews, presentations, meetings, phone or video conferences?  Do you become anxious, nervous tense up, loose track of where you're at, speak too fast, or even stutter?  Do people sometimes have trouble understanding you because English is your second language?  If you answered yes to any of the above, relax…help is finally here!  My name is Michael Williams and I stuttered for over 20 years.  For the past two decades I've made my living speaking.  I teach academic success as a professor, have conducted day-long and multi-day relationship and communication retreats, taught in churches, spoke on live T.V., radio and much more.  I've even taught small classes in Spanish.  I now work with people from all around the world helping them learn to speak more smoothly, fluently, clearly and confidently.  I call this type of speech \"Proactive.\"  Eventually, I created a step-by-step process for becoming a Proactive Speaker and I call this the PR90D Speech System.  If you struggle with speaking well, this course can literally transform your life.  You probably know from personal experience that not being able to speak well can limit your career choices, restrict your social life, and restrict your relationships.  I've worked with people who could not get jobs, or who were being paid up to 30% less because of their speech.  These were brilliantly intelligent people, but because of speech limitations, they were not able to express themselves the way they wanted.    In this course, I'm going to share with you one of the master techniques from my PRO90D Speech System  that can help you…  Speak more smoothly so that both you and those to whom you are speaking feel relaxed, tuned in and focused.     Speak more fluently so that your thoughts and words stream together in sync helping you present your thoughts and ideas in an intelligent and precise manner.      Speak more clearly so that your listeners can understand exactly what you're saying and what you mean.      Speak more confidently so that your listeners like and trust you, and therefore believe what you are saying.    As a result of putting into practice what you learn from this course, you will be able to:  Clear interviews knowing that you have put forth your best self. Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.    Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don't know all the answers.    Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.    If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/23972_35ee_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/start-speaking-smoothly-fluently-clearly-confidently/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Communication Skills"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":572,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738727-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"improve-communication-speak-smoothly-clearly-and-confidently"},{"id":"3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"23065","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.815Z","updated":"2012-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Career Mind Mastery: Interview Success Blueprint","headline":"A simple, science-based system for interview success focusing on the art of story telling and the magic of metaphors","description":" Career Mind Mastery: Learn How to Face an Interview - Your performance in the interview is all that stands between you and the role you want.

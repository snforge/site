The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2749258","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.041Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Planification stratégique","headline":"Comment planifier le succès de votre entreprise","description":"Planification stratégique- Tableau du plan stratégique globalStratégie Marketing- Tableau du plan marketing et comment il s’imbrique dans le plan stratégiqueMarketing web- Les stratégies marketing push et pull, Inbound et Outbound- Les moyens du marketing web- Le marketing web selon la connaissance du produit par les consommateurs- Les réseaux sociaux- Campagnes de bannières et remarketing- Référencement naturel ou SEO, être à la première place dans Google- Campagnes de Adwords- KPIs : mesures clés par action marketing, l’observation dans le plan marketing- Tableau de synthèse du marketing web","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749258_5617.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/planification-strategique/","language":"fr","tags":["Business","Management","Marketing Plan"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf771-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776946a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef17-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"planification-strategique"},{"id":"3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27625","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2015-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Web CopyWriting: Consistently Outperform Your Competitors","headline":"Discover the key strategies behind winning content for websites, blogs, social media and email marketing.","description":"Learn How the Web affects how people read online and what can you do to make your writing more effective.

Growing your customer base to achieve higher sales.","description":"In my Niche Marketing class you will discover how a streamlined niche marketing strategy will help you to grow your customer base who is ready to buy from you. It doesn't matter if you sell products or services.To succeed in promoting your business, it is important that you do not waste your marketing budget on unfruitful exercises. You do not want to waste your marketing efforts on the wrong people, especially those people who could not afford your product or services, or even those who would not buy your service or product anyway no matter how hard you may try.Many people mistakenly believe that marketing any type of business means having to pay for online or newspaper adverts and the buyers will come and buy. While this would be fantastic, in reality though this approach just doesn't work long time, if at all. And before you come to realise this, your marketing budget will be depleated and you will come to the realisation that your 'business has failed'.It's time to rethink your approach and accept the fact that whatever you offer, products or services, will only appeal to a defined niche market. Let's say you are selling apples, then anyone who doesn't like apples will not buy from you, even though they may have seen your advert. This is the dilemma you need to address, which is done through targeted advertising to a niche market - ultimately the market in which you operate.My niche marketing class is full of valuable tips and advice which makes it easy for everyone to develop a marketing strategy that works and which helps to grow your customer base and business as a whole.I also share with you the 5-step niche marketing method which includes:Identifying and targeting your niche marketHow to find your niche marketCollecting testimonialsHow to create niche marketing materials for your businessWays of how to contact your niche marketRemember: Niche Marketing does not need to be scary or difficult.All you need to do is to put into practice what you have learned.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20752_d801_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/expand-your-customer-base-by-narrowing-your-marketing-focus/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"niche-marketing-made-easy"},{"id":"3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17158","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.602Z","updated":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Local Marketing Blue Print","headline":"Learn how to dominate your competition with local Internet Marketing","description":" This local internet marketing course is designed for 2 people.

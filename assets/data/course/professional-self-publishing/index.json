Yet, traditional publishers are increasingly choosy about the authors with whom they work. At the same time, a dramatic increase in the number and quality of tools available to would-be authors has caused even many established authors to eschew traditional publishers and do things by themselves--often for much higher royalties. But you don't want your book to look, well, amateurish. What to do? In this twelve-part course, eight-time author, speaker, and publisher Phil Simon lets you in on secrets on how to professionally publish your own book. He addresses each step in the publishing process, offering his first-hand input and insider advice. He offers crucial comments on subsidy presses that claim to have authors' interests at heart and explains the different options available to you. Phil has been down this road more than a few times. After doing two books with traditional publishers, he started Motion Publishing to produce his next two books—and publish four others. (He then returned to traditional publishing books number five, six, seven, and eight.) In short, he knows where the bodies are buried. Learn valuable tips and avoid critical mistakes that can cost you a great deal of time, money, and peace of mind. About the InstructorPhil Simon is a frequent keynote speaker and recognized technology authority. He is the award-winning author of eight management books, most recently Analytics: The Agile Way. He consults organizations on matters related to communications, strategy, data, and technology. His contributions have appeared in The Harvard Business Review, The New York Times, and many other sites.

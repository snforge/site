Spring Boot 2.x, a feature-rich platform built from the Spring 5.x framework, is created by to help developers solve their complex problems with fewer configurations but with strong dependency management features.In this course, you will learn how to create various modules in a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) such as employee timesheets, leave management, and profiling. You will use Spring Boot 2.x to create your HRIS app while integrating Spring Web MVC, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data, RESTful web services, and clients. Above all, you'll use the latest version of Spring Security—5.0—to secure your apps and OAuth 2.x to implement an OpenID connection. You'll apply reactive programming with its Spring Web Flux and Project Reactor features. Finally, you will deploy your apps and services using some popular cloud and container platforms such as Spring Cloud Foundry, Docker, and AWS.By the end of the course, you will be confident in implementing the core features of Spring Boot 2.x to create scalable, optimal, and robust enterprise web applications.About the AuthorSherwin John Calleja Tragura started his career as a Java developer by focusing on the Documentum and Alfresco document management systems. His first exposure to mobile applications started in 2010 when he first installed and used the Alfresco mobile application, which featured core document content services.He is currently a technical corporate trainer and a subject matter expert on Java, JEE, and Spring application development. He is a certified EMC Documentum and OCP Java 7 Associate. He authored the following Packt books—Spring MVC Blueprints and Spring 5 Cookbook and also a Packt video course: Jakarta EE 8 Recipes. Before that, he was a technical editor for Alfresco Share, Alfresco 3 Records Management, Mastering Hibernate, and Delphi Cookbook.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743574_0ca9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-java-web-applications-with-spring-boot-2x/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Spring Boot"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37744a76-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d39-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d35-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd066-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef18-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"modern-java-web-applications-with-spring-boot-2-x"},"related":[{"id":"3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28373","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Advanced Java Programming","headline":"Take Your Java Programming Skills To The Next Level.

The secret is to know what's working, and not be distracted one bit by all the blinking new channels, tools, and sites that beg for your attention.Most people in business can get some traffic to their website, typically spend some time on Facebook or Twitter or any of the many social media sites available to them, and may do some basic search engine optimization. But when it comes to being “successful online\", most don't have the time or direction to know where and what to focus on. So we try to do it all – “jack of all trades, master of none\"Look. Everyone has access to Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, blah blah blah. The fact is your customers are really there too. They're searching on Google, they're hanging out on Facebook. So why then do most businesses just spin their wheels and flounder around in search of success?Think of it this way – anyone can own a set of golf clubs. Typically there's an assortment of 10 or more clubs in the bag – and you can whack the little dimpled thing with any one of those clubs.But to play golf well…to be a master of the game and make the ball go exactly where you want it to go…then you need to know what clubs to use and when. You need to know when the #7 club will put you within inches of your goal where #8 or 9 will leave you in the rough, lost in the sea of all the other golfers.… you need the inside secrets you will not discover casually on your own.It's the same with analysis.The advanced, mega powerful secrets do not appear to you magically, just because now you're in the position of having to sell something. You need a guide.Google Analytics Mastery is that guide.It guides you by the hand and leads you through the hell of understanding Google Analytics…… past the explosion of reports staring back at you on your screen…… past the smoking wreckage of failed business and ruined dreams……and directly to action based steps that will produce ethical wealth and heavenly happiness that will bring you to tears.This is the “insider\" course we wish was around when we were starting out online.  Learning even one or two of these secrets would have short-cut our own success by… oh… five… maybe ten years.  Probably more.Included in this best-selling eCourse Now Available On Udemy are secrets most businesses never discover… such as:How to quickly and properly set-up Google Analytics to reap the rewards of accurate dataThe magic of tracking goals – and why you can't afford not to have this functioningHow to make advertising dollars go further with connecting cost per click results to your web analyticsVery simple strategy to know where to focus on search engine optimization – what key phrases are worthwhile and which ones are a waste of your timeWhy your current data might be wrong, and a quick simple fix to solve itHow to navigate this endless realm of reports and crush the overwhelm – (Looking right over our shoulder we guide you on our screen)How to analyze in lightning speed by looking only at the data you need to seeWhy potential customers immediately bolt for the exit on your web site – and you didn't even realize you had a problem!How to look at the information visually if you're not a numbers person – or just hate the endless numbersThe insanely effective secret of marketers and what they're looking atHow to explode your offline marketing results through measuring strategies – yes even newspaper advertising can be trackedWhat is really driving sales or leads to your business, and whats just wasting your timeHow to spy on your prospects and see whats working with them on your siteHow some marketing affects other marketing and whether it turns to moneyHow to discover why your web sites failing within minutes of scanning the dataHow to measure a social media strategy immediately – we're talking the second you hit enter on that tweet or Facebook update Why certain pages on your web site are killing your businessWhat content on your web site you shouldn't touch – or risk back-tracking months or even years of progressWhat the search engines really think your business is about and how to fix itAnd… the mystery behind online success, how some marketers seem to do everything right, and how you can apply this priceless observations to your business…and this is just the beginning. Once you have the basics down, taking actionable, measurable steps towards marketing improvement is easy.That's just a small sample of what you'll find in this members only eCourse. There is over 5 hours of video training, watching our screens as we guide you to becoming an analytics master. And give you the roadmap you need to start creating your own ridiculously successful marketing campaigns.  The trainings are on average 10 minutes in length. This is a powerful way to learn… watch the video, then apply the learning to your own business! Progress at your own pace or cram all weekend long and implement everything. Whichever works best for you.In addition, there is over 3 hours of special video case studies for online business management included... This is where the rubber hits the road and we apply all you've learned to real businesses, real data, real lives!Plus (and probably more critical than any other part of the course) in addition to the all that you get in the members area training – you also receive Lifetime Membership to our monthly members only advanced trainings! Every month we continue to guide you by way of live webinars, special reports, or recorded case studies for members only to advance your learning and your results.When you think about it, this really isn't a training course you buy, rather an investment into your businesses foundation – membership that will continue to give back for years to come. In fact the course continues to evolve every month as our members grow from the advanced members only trainings. And because this isn't just what we teach, but what we do – if you get stuck, we're just a comment or email away as our Analytics team monitors the members area conversation.I don't care if you've never looked at a single page of web analytics in your life. Or if you're a veteran just trying to get further ahead with your results. Or if you've tried every shiny object that's come along and failed.None of that matters.The ONLY thing that matters…is your desire to get started. To start measuring ALL YOUR efforts and with laser focus, start taking the right actionable steps that bring in sales and new customers in a flood, fast and furious.This isn't brain surgery. You might be able to figure it all out on your own. Eventually.Or you can take advantage of the 10+ years of bumps, successes and failures figuring out how to maximize our results, and reduce effort. We've certainly made our mistakes trying to figure all this out, where to focus, what was really working, and what was completely a waste of our time. Lost staring at computer screens for hours, days even weeks – not realizing the time spent was all in vain.There is absolutely no sane reason why you should want to waste years of your own life attempting to cover this same ground.This is the course we would have killed to own when we started out.

Lack of EDA knowledge can expose you to the great risk of drawing incorrect, and potentially harmful, conclusions from your data analysis.In this course, you will learn how EDA helps you draw conclusions to make better sense of your data and implement correct techniques. We'll begin with a brief introduction to EDA, its importance, and advantages over BI tools. Using R libraries like dplyr and ggplot2, we will generate insights and formulate relevant questions for investigation and communicate the results effectively using visualizations. You will learn how to spot missing data and errors, validate assumptions, and identify the patterns for understanding the problem. Based on this, you’ll be able to select a correct ML model to use for your data.By the end of the course, you will be able to quickly get know and interpret various kinds of data sets you will be presented with, and easily understand how to handle and work with them in order to make them ready for further modeling activities.Please note that basic knowledge of R and R Studio, together with some knowledge of descriptive statistics, are key to getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorAndrea Cirillo is currently working as Internal Auditor at Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group, after gaining financial and external audit experience at Deloitte Touche & Tohmatsu and internal Audit experience at FNM, an Italian listed company.

If you want to learn internet marketing, if you're looking to build a business that has a real consistent, dependable income but have been struggling to make money online so far, then YES you're in the right place... You may or may not like everything you read on this page and some of it may sting a little, but I've never been ones to tell the truth with a sugar coating... Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... And here it is, it's the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) But why is that? Surely if everyone's buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest '1 click to riches' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn't they? Why are there so many people failing? Think about it like this... Most marketers aren't lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? Well here's the cold, hard truth: Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap 'systems' that don't work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass 'gurus' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it's not your fault. It's simply the nature of the industry. But look - If you've found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no \"magic bullet\". You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works! And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - And that's why I'm so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you'll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it's all geared up to you finally getting the results you've always wanted FAST! Inside you'll get a complete system: ● You'll know exactly what business to start ● How to get an unlimited amount of free traffic. ● How to create killer evergreen products that are guaranteed to sell ● How to attract partners that will allow your business to grow really really fast ● How to put your business on autopilot ● And how to scale your business to any income level that you desire. By the time you finish this internet marketing course you’ll have learnt internet marketing and you'll own a ROCK SOLID, profitable business. Your only decision will be to keep it or sell it. Seriously you'll have a real asset, an asset that's worth selling for a lump sum of money. How would you like a thirty thousand dollar payday? What would you do with that much cash? Think about this right now: What's it worth to you to have the skill to build a business that could produce that type of money on demand... ... Or to own a profitable evergreen business, the type of business that we described earlier (high traffic website, thousands of subscribers, powerful JV partners and relationships) Something that provides you with the total freedom to live the life you choose...

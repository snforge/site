The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"3775aa01-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"26090","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.937Z","updated":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Successful Crowdfunding: How to Win Backers And Raise Funds","headline":"An in-depth conversation around crowdfunding, what works and what not when it comes to sourcing money from the crowd.","description":" Hello and welcome to \"How to build a successful crowdfunding campaign\" video training.This training is for creators and entrepreneurs like you who want to know more about sourcing money from the crowd to fund your projects and ventures.It is also for supporters and investors who want to know what it means to fund a project or venture you’re passionate about and make the world a better place.Join us for an in-depth conversation around crowdfunding , what works and what not when it comes to sourcing money from the crowd.

I know how you feel but I found out how to land your dream job.","description":"\" To anyone who wants to enjoy a career in IT\" My name is Paul Browning and I worked as a police officer in the UK from 1988 to 2000. While I enjoyed the job immensely I felt I wanted to take on a new challenge, I already had an interest in computers. I had attended an course on PC assembly and learned a little bit about computer networking. I started to study for some Microsoft exams and began to apply for jobs in the IT industry. I landed a helpdesk job but as you can imagine, I quickly became bored doing password resets. I studied hard and passed some more exams and then got a role doing network support for Cisco systems in the UK. I later left to start my own IT company offering training and consulting services to companies both in the UK and internationally. I sold the company in 2008 and now run an online Cisco training company. During the time I trained students I helped many hundreds of them get their break into a career in IT. I watched them move from helpdesk roles into networking and often into freelance consulting contracts or even their own companies. I’ve also worked with hundreds of IT managers who have shared with me the things they look for when looking to hire IT staff for their companies. I’ve even been through the process myself when I was looking to get out of the police force. I see people making the same mistakes time and time again when they are trying to get a job in IT: Sending resumes out and hoping for the bestWaiting for jobs to appear online before applyingSending generic resumes which will never be readFailing to prepare properly for technical interviewsNot presenting themselves professionally to companiesand many more common mistakes Break Into IT has been devised with people like you in mind. It is a one stop training resource to help you plan, prepare and execute your plan to get you from where you are now to where you want to be. Here are just a few of the things you will learn: How to find the best jobs before they appear onlineHow to tap into vast networks of people willing to help youThe secrets to getting your resume readHow to get called for interviewsHow to ace technical interviewsStanding out from the crowdHow to bridge the lack of experience problemHow to negotiate your salary and benefitsHow to get advancement once you get inand much more These tips will help you if you want to apply for any IT roles including: Networking\nDesktop support\nHelpdesk\nProgramming\nWeb design\nProject management and support Most people are doing it all wrong and never get called for interviews. They wonder why but because they don't know how the system works they will be forever in the dark. These principles have been used my thousands of my students to break into IT. I hope you enjoy applying them to land your dream job. I hope you enjoy the course.

Idea to Income in Thirty Days.","headline":"Uncover what you love to do and turn it into a profitable business. Daily actions help you get clarity and stay focused.","description":"**** all new case study material added 2016 *** Starting a business seems like a great idea.... But it can soon become overwhelming. So many requirements, regulations. And that's even without assessing whether we have a marketable idea and whether it will create the kind of success we really want. From idea to implementation This course is designed to cut through all of that and to take you on a thirty day journey from inspiration to income. I want to take your desire and your passion and show you how to turn it into practical actions that allow you to come up with profitable business ideas and your passion and to create income before the month is over. Accessible training in bite sized chunks Day by day, step-by step, this course will strip away much of the overwhelm you may feel as a new entrepreneur. It will take you on a journey from coming up with profitable business ideas, discovering where your talents lie, to testing and packaging what you are going to sell, and to show you how to actually make money now. You need to check out your idea against these three criteria There are so many books and courses for new businesses and coming up with profitable business ideas. Books that tell you about business plans and accounts. But before you start to pull together these processes, you need to know that you have: 1. Profitable business ideas. 2. A business model that is a fit for the life and income you want to create. 3. A product or service that people want to buy! Shortcut your success I work with clients who sometimes find years later that their business might be successful financially but they want to get out and so something they love. Or they have a great idea but they just can't make money with it. Or they have a business that runs their life, rather than a business that gives them the life they want. I don't want this for you. I created this course so that you could shortcut this journey. Yes you will need the right legal and financial framework. But you must also build your business on a foundation that will give you the fulfillment, the life and the income you want. Check you are on the right track right from the start This course shows you how to understand and rigorously test your profitable business ideas so that you know you are on the right track before you start (or to help you get re-oriented when you've hit a roadblock!). This is for you if... This course is for you if you want to start a business doing what you love. If you want to feel fulfilled by what you do. And you want to create a lifestyle that works for you. This course is for you if you've already started a business but you're feeling as if you didn't take the right path. Or if you know that you've found your passion but you're struggling to turn it into income. Or if you simply want to know how to do the things that will move you forward day by day. Because it's the staying in action that gets results for you. Get Momentum: Start A Business You Love combines motivation with real, practical, actionable strategies. Anyone who is running a service business or a is a solo-preneur will find it especially valuable - creatives, coaches, consultants, designers, healers... This is designed for you. We'll cover: ● How to build a business from your strengths - because this will make you more successful ● Why people buy what you're selling and why are will buy from you ● How to do the 'five minute money check-in' (do this before you make important decisions!) ● How to create income before the course is over ● Why knowing your revenue model will help you know how to grow your business ● Measuring success an easy way to monitor the numbers you need to pay attention to ● How to take one step at a time to achieve your ambitions (hint: I tell my clients I can get rid of 80%% of the things on their to-do list and this technique will help you do that too) ● Identify and know how you are going to achieve your money goal (with downloadable spreadsheet) ● Where to begin delegating even if you think you can't afford it yet ● Three very simple questions that will help you stay on track when the course is over Practical actions And the best part is that this course isn't just about learning. It's about practical actions. Every day you will take an action step that is relevant and specific to you and your profitable business ideas. This is what will take you from idea to income - this is what separates those who succeed from those who stay stuck - it's about the doing not just the learning...

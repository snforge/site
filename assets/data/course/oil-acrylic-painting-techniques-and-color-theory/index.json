I owe my job tohim. His teaching techniques and teaching style made everything finally click.I just got it! I started drawing figures that looked good. What a greatfeeling. Even if I never landed my dream career, just the feeling of drawinggreat figures was worth every penny Neil charges. I can’t believe he offers somuch for so little.” – Tim.  Don’t give up on yourself. You can draw people, and youwon’t believe how little it will cost you. You want to draw for a living, or paint for a living, butthe human figure is holding you back, but it doesn’t have to anymore. After yougo through 10 hours of video containing my step-by-step drawing lessons and mybest-kept secrets, you’ll draw the human figure like never before! Guaranteed.I mean that. I can guarantee it because I’ve seen it work again and againfor my students.  You should see Kim’s before and after, but I don’t know howto post that here.  It worked for me. You should see how my figures used to look.I almost gave up! Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked, I madequick leaps. Would you believe that before and after was only 30 days after Ifigured the secrets of figure drawing out? Yes. It’s true. It only takes sometwo weeks. I want to repeat that because it’s so awesome. You can learn how to draw the human figure in two weeks! What? Crazy, right? My students are evidence. I am evidence.I’ve seen it work for me and others. You just have to watch the videos and do the exercises.That’s it. You can have that dream job, drawing or painting. You can make moneywith your art. You can, you can, you can. But you’ve tried art courses? You read some figure drawingbooks? You even paid for personal art lessons? Why will my course be any different?  Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tellyou how important it is to master the stick figure before you even startdrawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most masterartists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level. They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learningprocess that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro.That is what this course does for you. It turns you into a figure drawing professional. I guarantee you will finally be happy with your figuredrawings once you complete Master the Human Figure that I will give your moneyback if you aren’t. Of the 1,297 people that have bought the course so far, notone of them has complained. Not one. But you won’t ever be able to draw the human figure?  If you can master the basic stick figure, you can draw thehuman figure.  It’s true. Students have told me I should charge $500 for this 10 hourcourse Master the Human Figure. I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69dollars. What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me. But why? Why would I do that? Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, nooffice rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instantstreaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them.  “I had spent a lot ofmoney previously on books and classes however what i have learned from bothyour Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and ireally enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance ofpractice, practice, practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excitedand motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable, THANK YOU...”–OrlandoPiedrahita, CA Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 toproduce a new, flat-screen TV, and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m notgoing to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it. Why do my students believe I should charge $500?  Because you get 10 hours of video lessons.

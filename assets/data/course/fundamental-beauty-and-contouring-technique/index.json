Its originator, Dr. Roger Callahan, first formulated his school of energy psychology in the late 1970s. His schema consists of tapping on the acupoints of the body in particular sequences that he feels is necessary to relieve depression, anxiety, addictions, and other mental health problems.  He has validated his technique through many research studies where TFT was shown to perform much better than many other psychological techniques such as cognitive therapy. This course investigates Thought Field Therapy in lecture form and video demonstrations. It is suitable for both the lay person and clinicians. Developed by Gary Craig, Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT is the best known and most popular school of energy psychology. EFT is essentially an offshoot of Thought Field Therapy (TFT). EFT is a simple, quick and painless technique that can be used without a therapist's assistance, making EFT the perfect self-help technique. This course describes EFT in detail in both lecture form and video demonstrations.</p></p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/27244_ca31_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-emotional-freedom-technique-and-thought-field-therapy/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Mental Health","EFT"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":14,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742367-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea524-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b260-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learn-emotional-freedom-technique-and-thought-field-therapy"},{"id":"377582f7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"25946","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.936Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 Tutorial Video - Infinite Skills","headline":"Learn the secrets that make Elements as powerful as the full version of Photoshop in these Photoshop Elements tutorials.","description":"In this training course for Adobe Photoshop Elements 11, expert Andy Anderson teaches you about the tools and techniques that are available in this powerful software used for managing and editing your photos.

What People Are Saying \"This course was great. I thought since Elements was already pretty easy to use, I wouldn't learn much. But these videos brought my capabilities to an entirely new level.\" -J Stratlin \"I really got a lot out of these videos because of the way Jerron uses examples, instead of speeding through menus everything was clearly laid out in steps onscreen. Thank you.\" -Donica Waverly \"Just what I needed...a very nice look at the main tools...with cool sections on camera raw and panoramic merging that gave me more options even when shooting.\" -Ryan Schutto</p></p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/15104_fd2c_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/photoshop-elements-10/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Photoshop"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":15,"isFree":false,"matches":["377582f7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca953-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad491-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d970-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c805-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"adobe-photoshop-elements-10-made-easy"},{"id":"376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"14766","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.588Z","updated":"2017-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Photoshop Essentials","headline":"Gain massive skills and learn a ton of Photoshop techniques!","description":" Delve head-long into the world of Photoshop with expert video trainer, artist, and designer Geoff Blake in this massive 14-plus hour, 2-disc DVD set!

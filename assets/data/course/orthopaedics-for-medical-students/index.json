With this course I want to help you having success with the german language and passing the so called Fachsprachprüfung to be able to practice medicine in germany.The course gives you a comprehensive amount of material, specific for each chapter of the medical language test in germany. The videos show you how to communicate with patients, how to translate and intonate labvalues, and how to write doctor letters. The letters are adjusted and made by doctors, working in germany since years. Additional to that, I took from multiple clinics in germany the medical administration dokuments, adjusted and combined them to one big dokument. The complete course has audio. This way you can read, write and hear in the same time.I hope the course helps you with studying more efficiantly and more successfully.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746916_e231_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/german-for-doctors/","language":"en","tags":["Teaching & Academics","Language","German Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37738729-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37747182-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c06-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733901-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"deutsch-fuer-mediziner-german-for-doctors"},{"id":"37781b04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2751910","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.046Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"CIW Web Design Specialist | 1D0-520","headline":"Pass CIW Web Design Specialist | 1D0-520 exam on the first attempt.","description":"Course in Pre-Launch Mode, a total number of questions will be around 130+.CIW Web Design Specialist | 1D0-520 Test seriesIt covers 100% of the CIW exam 1D0-520 certification syllabus.Exam Topics:The CIW Web Design Specialist exam is for the individual who wants to develop the skills necessary to specialize in Web site design.

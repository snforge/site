What People Are Saying \"This course was great. I thought since Elements was already pretty easy to use, I wouldn't learn much. But these videos brought my capabilities to an entirely new level.\" -J Stratlin \"I really got a lot out of these videos because of the way Jerron uses examples, instead of speeding through menus everything was clearly laid out in steps onscreen. Thank you.\" -Donica Waverly \"Just what I needed...a very nice look at the main tools...with cool sections on camera raw and panoramic merging that gave me more options even when shooting.\" -Ryan Schutto</p></p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/15104_fd2c_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/photoshop-elements-10/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Photoshop"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":15,"isFree":false,"matches":["377582f7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca953-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad491-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d970-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c805-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"adobe-photoshop-elements-10-made-easy"},{"id":"376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"14766","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.588Z","updated":"2017-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Photoshop Essentials","headline":"Gain massive skills and learn a ton of Photoshop techniques!","description":" Delve head-long into the world of Photoshop with expert video trainer, artist, and designer Geoff Blake in this massive 14-plus hour, 2-disc DVD set!

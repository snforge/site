IT’S TIME TO BUILD A CAREER OF INFLUENCE & DISTINCTION THROUGH A PERSONAL BRAND.With so much competition and change happening in the market, it’s more important than ever to create a personal brand.

By creating an authentic and meaningful personal brand you will be: ●  Valued for who you are professionally and personally ●  Attract the promotions and projects you desire ●  Create new opportunities and demand for your talents ●  Walk your career path with integrity ●  Distinguish yourself in your company and your field ●  Command more money while doing what you love In this month long course on branding process you have 1 video per day as well as a workbook with daily exercises that will help you reveal the soul of your brand so that you can craft a mission statement, tagline, face barriers to your career goals and attract clients. </p></p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/26359_3437_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reinvent-yourself-in-30-days/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Personal Transformation","Personal Branding"],"rating":3.9,"reviews":7,"isFree":false,"matches":["376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711624-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"reinvent-yourself-in-30-days"},"related":[{"id":"377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742994","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.149Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn The Power Of Self-Discipline","headline":"How to be self-disciplined in order to gain success in every aspect of your life","description":"Self-discipline is not a neat little trait that we can choose to have.

The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund.

LATEST: Course Updated Again for September 2015Learn EXACTLY what I've taught international brands like McDonald's and evian... in only 2 hours!Gain the skills major brands have paid hundreds of thousands for. Quickly and easily.Over 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.Have you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"I've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.It has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.I make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.When I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.I know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.Every single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.Nothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics.

And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.What this is course IS NOT:I do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.I will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.I won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.But, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.Every minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...Enroll now!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25581_4b8c_14.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/branding-public-relations-social-media-cc/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Business Branding"],"rating":3.5,"reviews":34,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-master-branding-public-relations-and-social-media"},{"id":"3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24383","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.885Z","updated":"2013-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Archetypal Branding: The Secrets of building a Premium Brand","headline":"How the World's Best Brands build Brand Identity that turns Consumers into Brand Lovers that are Loyal for Life","description":"\"Archetypal Branding: The Secrets of Building a Premium Brand\" is designed to provide you with a systematic way to: • Clearly define the Brand so that it is compelling and credible to your key Target Audiences. • Create a Brand Identity that all key internal Constituencies can agree on and work from. • Increase the Reputation, Image, perceived Value and Brand Awareness of your Company Take this Branding Your Business Course and learn how to build a Brand for your Business that commands Premium Prices and turns Customers into Brand Advocates that are Loyal for Life. </p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/24383_9ccf_10.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/archetypal-branding/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Branding","Business Branding"],"rating":3.9,"reviews":294,"isFree":true,"matches":["376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733909-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711624-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d11a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789031-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37724ea3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"archetypal-branding-the-secrets-of-building-a-premium-brand"},{"id":"37711624-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17448","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.688Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Smarter Branding Without Breaking the Bank","headline":"Contains dozens of practical, low-cost branding techniques to catapult your brand and increase your revenues immediately","description":"Smarter Branding Without Breaking the Bank:  Five Proven Marketing Strategies You Can Use Right Now to Build Your Business at Low Cost - or No Cost at All In this course, international branding expert Brenda Bence has created the definitive guide to branding on a tight budget.

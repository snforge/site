It is designed to teach other counselors and coaches these very powerful and effective techniques for helping their clients too. The program is also a great compliment to any helping process by providing structure and tools for use with clients. I combined the classics with some of the newest, most powerful personal transformation technologies available today to create this interactive process for Overcoming Childhood Trauma, personal healing and development.

Reframing should be in the water we drink, scientists say. Reframing is the ability to change your perspective deliberately. But why is it praised like that? What happens in the brain when you reframe? What are the inner and outer effects? And how do you do it? You are invited to share your most powerful reframings - either as a comment to the group or by contacting Anette Prehn at anette@anetteprehn.com This course is targeted for professionals, managers and executives which will show in the examples given and the questions asked. However, anyone is free to join so that as many as possible may harvest the benefits of reframing.

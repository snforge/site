Yet, traditional publishers are increasingly choosy about the authors with whom they work.

But you don't want your book to look, well, amateurish. What to do? In this twelve-part course, eight-time author, speaker, and publisher Phil Simon lets you in on secrets on how to professionally publish your own book. He addresses each step in the publishing process, offering his first-hand input and insider advice. He offers crucial comments on subsidy presses that claim to have authors' interests at heart and explains the different options available to you. Phil has been down this road more than a few times.

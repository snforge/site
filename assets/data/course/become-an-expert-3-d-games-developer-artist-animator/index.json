Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"37720084-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19615","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.696Z","updated":"2012-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Unity 3d Game Development - iOS, Android, & Web - Beginners","headline":"Want to get into making high quality games, but don't know where to start?

The course teaches you how to use the SFML library for C++, to start working with graphics, events and sound to create a 2D game. Everything is done step by step with the help of videos, so it's easy to follow along and learn. At the end of the course you will know what you need for game programming and will be able to start making your own games. Warning: This course was published more than 2 years ago and the technology used in it progresses fast. The current most updated version of SFML (2.1) doesn't work out of the box with Visual Studio 2013 (or the express editions) and it requires more work to setup. If you want to follow this course easily, then you should use the 2012 or older version of Visual Studio (or the express edition) which can still be officially downloaded from Microsoft site.

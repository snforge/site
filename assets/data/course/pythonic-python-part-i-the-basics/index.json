These powerful techniques are often used in applied machine learning to achieve the best overall performance.In this unique course, after installing the necessary tools you will jump straight into the bagging method so as to get the best results from algorithms that are highly sensitive to specific data—for example, algorithms based on decision trees. Next, you will discover another powerful and popular class of ensemble methods called boosting. Here you'll achieve maximal algorithm performance by training a sequence of models, where each given model improves the results of the previous one. You will then explore a much simpler technique called voting, where results from multiple models are achieved using simple statistics such as the mean average. You will also work hands-on with algorithms such as stacking and XGBoost to improve performance.By the end of this course, you will know how to use a variety of ensemble algorithms in the real world to boost your machine learning models.Please note that a working knowledge of Python 3; the ability to run simple commands in Shell (Terminal); and also some basic machine learning experience are core prerequisites for taking and getting the best out of this course.About the AuthorJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and programmed professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share this with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups, he was involved in. He failed miserably then. He then discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning, which he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to the “Keep it simple” mantra. He is the author of multiple bestselling video courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Real-World Deep Learning Python Projects and AI in Finance.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742004_65b9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Python"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769462-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"boosting-machine-learning-models-in-python"},{"id":"3777cce7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750884","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.046Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Linear Regression : Prerequisites for Deep Learning","headline":"Linear Regression basic concepts in python with hand's on project","description":"In this basic course you are going to learn:Data analytics data analytics introTypes of analyticsAnalytical approachWhat is machine learning and Reinforcement learningSupervised Learning & Unsupervised learning Covariance and Correlation in DataTypes of the algorithm in supervised learning=v6Regression tableCovariance and Correlation in DataUnivariate AnalysisMultivariate AnalysisAssumptions of LinearityLimitations of RegressionCase Study For Linear Regression Performance Analysis","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2750884_c67f.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-regression/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Data Science","Deep Learning"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3779a1a9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e08e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716447-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"linear-regression-prerequisites-for-deep-learning"},{"id":"37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24823","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.886Z","updated":"2019-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners","headline":"Learn to program using the Java programming language","description":" Learn to program in the Java programming language.

In 114 separate tutorials, Mike gives you a solid working knowledge of object-oriented programming, even if you’re completely new to coding. He demonstrates how to use variables and data types, objects and classes, arrays, inheritance and polymorphism and distinguishes how working in C# differs from other types of code. Once you gain your confidence in the underlying areas, you’ll be ready to complete the functional To-Do List app that is integrated into the course.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/11152_b642_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-sharp-for-beginners/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C#"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":309,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learning-c-net-programming-for-beginners"},{"id":"376a8670-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"8082","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.169Z","updated":"2019-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Ruby Programming for Beginners","headline":"Learn Ruby Programming the fast and easy way!","description":" Learn Ruby today!

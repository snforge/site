Now on the other hand imagine what would happen if you never stepped up and made yourself a priority. Imagine how your life would be impacted. Imagine how much more pain or despair you’d remain in if you, yes YOU, didn't take action and unabashedly loved yourself in the way only you know how. Imagine the suffering that would be created by you not doing this. So, what'll it be? Which choice will you make?

If you won't like what you see, don't worry: there is a 30 day money back guaranty on all Udemy courses :) In App Purchases are the Holy Grail of app monetization. But for years it has been a real hassle for newbie developers to add In App Purchases to their apps. One had to be a coding genius to understand all the aspects of implementing IAP. Just take a look at Apple's documentation. This was just overly complicated for me! I wanted something simple and fast! Than I found MKStoreKit by Mugunth Kumar. MKStoreKit does all the magic of dealing with all that complicated stuff. Hurray!!! But, wait. I found no comprehensive MKStoreKit tutorial explaining how to use MKStoreKit. There isn't any documentation at all on how to implement it into your Xcode project!(besides Kumar's brief description which just isn't enough) I have dug myself into the code and after countless sleepless nights I have made this MKStoreKit tutorial course for you. It documents every step you have to make to learn in order to take advantage of in app monetization. Note: for now MKStoreKit is not advised for auto-renewable subscriptions, but if you want to add consumabels or non-consumables, take this course now:) This course covers all you will ever need to know about adding In App Purchases to your app using MKStoreKit. ☛ Take a look at the FREE lecture inside ☛ iOS6 ready ☛ simple, fast, easy What are you waiting for?

Once we've gotten the hang of programming, we'll create three more apps as we explore Apple's iOS software development kit. I'll walk you through every detail of developing the apps from project creation, through every line of code, and on to testing the app. Finally, in the last lesson I'll let you watch over my shoulder as I submit an app to The App Store. Take the course now, learn iOS development now and have your first fully functional iPhone app before the end of the day.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20366_6760_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/iosdevelopment/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Mobile Apps","iOS Development"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":2487,"isFree":true,"matches":["3773d548-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d977-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d975-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376afba1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae31-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722792-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716447-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b749-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779c8b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749896-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"this-is-how-you-make-i-phone-apps-i-os-development-course"},{"id":"3771d977-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19636","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.695Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Objective C for iPhone-iPad App Programming","headline":"Learn how to write apps for iPhone and iPad apps with Objective-C.","description":"In this course you will Learn Objective C and its basic programming understanding.

Expert trainer and published author Tony Bove introduces you to using the iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) and Xcode to build apps for the iPhone, iPad and Universal apps. Even if you have never programmed before or built apps before, by the end of this course you will be fully capable of building apps and submitting them to the App Store. Before you even start building an app, Tony takes you through what makes a good app, and the limitations you will face on the iPhone and iPad platforms. You will learn how to design a good user interface, how to use the iOS simulator, how to program in Xcode, and how an app runs. From there, you will jump right into building apps: designing the interface, including iAds in your app, animating, timing, and much more. You will also learn how to build iPad specific apps to take advantage of a larger screen and additional features. Finally, you will learn how to package your apps, and prepare them for submission to the app store. By the conclusion of this course you will be fully capable of designing, creating and submitting an app to the Apple App Store, using the iOS SDK and Xcode. The author has included working files, to allow you to work alongside him as he builds an app throughout this video tutorial.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8416_140f_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/beginners-guide-to-iphone-ipad-app-creation/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Mobile Apps","iOS Development"],"rating":4,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["3773d548-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d977-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37724ea6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d975-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716447-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae31-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d112-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770990-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"beginners-how-to-create-i-phone-and-i-pad-apps-zero-coding"}]}}

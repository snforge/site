Your old-school promotion isn’t producing results, which doesn’t surprise you since you just read in the Harvard Business Review that traditional marketing is dead. And that’s not really news either, because you keep hearing about how people are trusting traditional advertising less and less and trusting peer/social recommendations more and more. You’ve tried growing your business with \"the aggregators,\" but a lot of those leads are low quality, all of them are \"cold\" by nature, and the prices for those services just keep going up. Size of Sphere = Size of Income? So, you find yourself in this place where you’ve maxed out your sphere of influence using traditional methods. And anyone who’s been in real estate longer than 5 minutes knows that the size of your sphere determines the size of your income. More connections = more money, right? New Life for Your Business And you think, “Those old, cold and expensive methods just aren’t working for me. I need to find a new way to expand my network and inject new life into my business.” And so, for all those reasons, you decide to give Twitter a try. And here’s what you discover: That Twitter users are the most active and dynamic in all of Social Media  That you can use keywords and laser-focused geo-targeting to connect with people right in your community That there’s not a lot of competition, because most people do the wrong things, get no results and blame Twitter for the lackluster ROI - when in reality the problem wasn't Twitter at all, but simply those people doing the wrong things That Twitter is exploding, and there are now nearly HALF A BILLION people using the platform Grow Your Network So, you start connecting with more and more people, growing your network every single day. You quickly realize that Twitter users love to engage and make new connections. And you discover a few things that you did not expect. That the learning curve is not that steep. And that Twitter is actually fun. Yes, FUN! You nurture along hundreds of relationships, building and building a little bit more each and every week. And you wake up one day and realize that you’ve expanded your network dramatically while doing 99% of it at home in front of your computer. Or from your smart phone or you iPad. And you realize that what you heard was actually true: that Twitter really is the greatest relationship creation machine of all time. And you think, \"I only wish I had started using Twitter sooner.\" Take this course and let me show you how to grow your sphere of influence using Twitter.... PS: This course isn't going to be ideally suited to all personalities or communication styles. If you purchase this course and feel even a smidgen of disappointment, Udemy will give you your money back, so long as it's within the first 30 days, no questions asked. PPS: Here is some \"Social Proofing\" I've received from a myriad of key players in the real estate industry.  PPPS: Here is what happened when an industry VIP followed my advice and dramatically improved his Twitter experience quickly.

LATEST: Course Updated Again for September 2015Learn EXACTLY what I've taught international brands like McDonald's and evian... in only 2 hours!Gain the skills major brands have paid hundreds of thousands for. Quickly and easily.Over 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.Have you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"I've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.It has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.I make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.When I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.I know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.Every single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.Nothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics. And you pay NOTHING EXTRA for this ongoing content.Plus, Udemy has a 30 day guarantee. And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.What this is course IS NOT:I do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.I will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.I won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.But, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.Every minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...Enroll now!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25581_4b8c_14.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/branding-public-relations-social-media-cc/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Business Branding"],"rating":3.5,"reviews":34,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-master-branding-public-relations-and-social-media"},{"id":"3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24387","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.886Z","updated":"2012-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"How to Develop an Effective Marketing Plan","headline":"Get the answers you need to grow your business through better marketing strategies.","description":"This “Strategic Marketing Plan: How to Write a Marketing Plan” course will provide you with the knowledge you need to develop a comprehensive and effective marketing plan to create new or improve your current marketing strategies and grow your business.  You'll learn how to spend your marketing time and effort on the things that will work for your business!

Growing your customer base to achieve higher sales.","description":"In my Niche Marketing class you will discover how a streamlined niche marketing strategy will help you to grow your customer base who is ready to buy from you. It doesn't matter if you sell products or services.To succeed in promoting your business, it is important that you do not waste your marketing budget on unfruitful exercises. You do not want to waste your marketing efforts on the wrong people, especially those people who could not afford your product or services, or even those who would not buy your service or product anyway no matter how hard you may try.Many people mistakenly believe that marketing any type of business means having to pay for online or newspaper adverts and the buyers will come and buy. While this would be fantastic, in reality though this approach just doesn't work long time, if at all. And before you come to realise this, your marketing budget will be depleated and you will come to the realisation that your 'business has failed'.It's time to rethink your approach and accept the fact that whatever you offer, products or services, will only appeal to a defined niche market. Let's say you are selling apples, then anyone who doesn't like apples will not buy from you, even though they may have seen your advert.

Using journaling to transform your life","headline":"Create lasting change through journaling, writing, reflecting and creative writing exercises. Memoir preparation","description":"OverviewWriting to heal takes you on a journey that asks you  to first pick up your pen and write in a journal.  To then reflect on what you have written and  rewrite it with positive intention, so that you change your story.As you change the way in which you view life and  your story, your life will change.  Add  in the dimension of creative  writing exercises, through short stories, prose or poems, suddenly  you are on an adventure where you are in control of your destiny.  You can now decide what happens to the  characters and what the outcome of the tale might be.Let me hold your hand and guide you the process I use with my coaching clients.Course structureWe start by looking at what journaling is and in the first few modules get you started on your journaling journey and writing each  day.There are a number of different creative writing exercises for you to use as inspiration and kick-starts.After you have got used to your daily journaling, it  is then time to start reflecting and included are a number of reflection  exercises, which are designed to help you see where your unhelpful patterns of  behaviour are and to encourage you to change thought patterns, habits, beliefs  and perceptions.Both journaling and reflecting are immensely healing  activities in themselves. I have added in creative life writing as I have  witnessed both my clients and myself getting huge benefits from melding fact  with fiction to come up with some factional stories, which put us back in the  driving seat of our lives.How long will it take?It takes as long as you would like. How you work through the material  should be in a way that suits you. You are encouraged to journal for 30 days to create a good habit.  The exercises are designed to get you thinking and for you to a) follow in a linear fashion or b)  randomly try things.Why take this course?This course is for anyone who feels 'stuck' and  would like to try a novel approach to changing their life and starting to heal.  Writing is cathartic and when you  add in reflection and creative life writing the opportunities for change and  healing open up.What else?Many people who use journalling have discovered that  they also have a book inside of them.   You may not want to publish your book, however, this course will lead  you from journaling into creative life writing and give you the confidence to  write a book if you so choose.If you can journal you can write, if you can write  short stories you can write a book.                                                                So start learning these highly creative writing exercises  to reveal your full potential. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/22643_564d_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-to-heal/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Journaling"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":69,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c5b34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea522-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d3a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"writing-to-heal-using-journaling-to-transform-your-life"},{"id":"37736015-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"21993","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.814Z","updated":"2017-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Introduction To Story Boarding","headline":"Learn the language of film while mastering drawing to achieve great Story Boards for the inner Story teller in you.","description":"This course is about learning the craft of storyboarding for animation artists, filmmakers, game design artists, graphic designers and people interested in learning how the storyboarding process affects the film, game and design work you may be doing. In this course you can find lectures, video demonstrations and PDFs that will help further the information provided in each session. You may be able to complete the lectures in a 1 week time period but I would encourage going back over the material as many times as you like until you have mastered the information provided. Plus, there will be ongoing discussions between students and myself to help build the independent animation, game and film communities. This course is structured in sessions that consist of lectures. The students will need to watch or listen to the lectures provided and work alongside the demonstrations to help them follow the information provided. You will in some sessions be asked to read PDF materials provided in the sessions. Considering the possibility of a high volume of students, I will try my best to answer most of the questions and give feedback when I host live sessions. I also plan on scheduling live sessions with industry professionals so that you get a clearer understanding of the techniques used here. By taking this course in Intro to Storyboarding, you will gain the foundations of a visual storyteller. The goal here is to insure that the people who sign up will learn to use industry methods to further enhance the stories they would like to tell. I would like to help create new storyboard artists for filmmaking, game design, photography for narratives, and graphic design by adding some proven creative storytelling skills to their visual work.

It won't tell you 'how to make a million dollars overnight'. Instead it is a unique, detailed step-by-step guide to becoming a successful freelance copywriter working from home, from scratch. Step by step Follow each step and you can make between £300 ($450) a day and - with more experience - £500 ($750) a day. Not exactly a get rich quick formula, but a very respectable income. Especially for someone who is their own boss, has few overheads, doesn't have to commute to work, and chooses exactly how much or how little work they want to take on. Because my website has been live for some time now, I get more than I need and have to turn work away. Is it possible? Sure, and in this guide I will show you – in detail – everything you need to know. Things like:• How to begin from scratch and quickly build a portfolio• How to find clients - fast• How to market yourself• How to build a copywriter website in just five days - for free• How to find the most profitable projects and drop the rest• How much to charge In fact, I will even share my killer 'terms and conditions' that enable me to close more business at higher prices. I will: • Introduce you to the jargon – no getting caught out as a beginner• Show how to walk your clients through a brief, how to research topics, how to write for print and how to write for the web• We will look at different writing styles (or 'tone of voice' as the marketing people call it). • I will teach you questioning techniques for telephone interviews (I do all my work over the net and by phone) and show you some clever, low cost phone recording kit and transcription software so that you won't even have to take notes• Plus lots of tricks of the trade that save valuable time and mark you out as a real pro And give you stacks of links to real samples of different types of copy, templates, tick lists and so on, plus more detailed descriptions of some of the topics covered in this book (build your own free library). In fact, everything you need to get you started with confidence.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/12248_0b1d_12.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-become-a-copywriter-from-home/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Content Marketing","Copywriting"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":1935,"isFree":false,"matches":["37720085-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774718a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d543-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37702bc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"copywriting-become-a-freelance-copywriter-your-own-boss"},{"id":"376c5b34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"10251","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.173Z","updated":"2011-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Block Buster: Overcoming Writer's Block","headline":"Stuck in writing?

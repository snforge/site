Consequently, container orchestration has become a critical piece of infrastructure for enterprises on their digital transformation journey. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration.This course provides a tour of how to debug issues with the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure and presents a working conceptual model of how clusters operate. You will be addressing common problems faced by developers in cluster management, monitoring, and logging. Subsequently, we examine common issues when creating and deploying apps on Kubernetes.By the end of the course, you'll have gained full control of your Kubernetes infrastructure and will be able to manage it with ease.Please note a working knowledge of Kubernetes is required for this course.About the AuthorPradipta Kumar BanerjeeIBM, Senior Technical Staff Member, Bangalore, IndiaPradipta is a Senior Technical Staff Member for the IBM Cloud Private platform and leads cloud-native platform initiatives for IBM Power Microprocessor.

Enterprise systems are shifting towards micro-systems. With a RESTFul service, we usually have client applications operating on various platforms. At present, only one tool is capable of a building a RESTFul web service along with the client's applications using a single code base—an that's Delphi!In this course, you’ll learn to use the Delphi IDE to construct a complete system. We’ll show you how to create Server, Android, and Windows clients in a fast and efficient way. You’ll learn to code VCL applications and work with embedded SQL databases. You’ll also develop a RESTful application based on DataSnap technology with WebBroker. Finally, you’ll build a complete courier software system using Delphi with a single codebase.

Are you frustrated when your children don't pay attention to your directions and requests? Psychologists have found a set of simple and powerful techniques that can turn this situation around -- and I have summarized all of these ideas in this course. You will learn the strategies that I have taught hundreds of parents over the past 20 years in my work as a clinical psychologist. You'll gain insight into your own parenting style, and you'll learn effective, research-supported parenting techniques with my step-by-step approach. I'll provide you with examples and handouts that will encourage you to put these techniques into action and to stick with the program. Parents whose children misbehave often will learn how to effectively manage these challenges. First-time parents will find lots of practical advice to successfully navigate through misbehavior that occurs in all families. This approach will be most helpful for parents whose children are between 4 and 13 years old, but teachers, child care providers, and grandparents will find this information to be extremely useful, too. I'm so excited to provide you with these parenting tools. I've shared them with many others by working directly with families, teaching university classes, researching family dynamics, appearing on television, and being quoted for newspapers and blogs. Join more than 1,000 parents who have enrolled already. This class will make it easier for you to be a great parent! Enroll now and let's work together to make it happen.

This course is one of a track of courses aimed at small web business owners, students and developers/designers with little or no prior training in software/web usability. Before you attend this course, we recommend that you take the free, 30 minute course called \"Introduction to Web and eCommerce User eXperience Design\". As well as providing a high level overview for this and other related courses from the same OUXI curriculum training track, it will explain how the small fees you invest in these courses could pay off in thousands of dollars in increased revenues from your ecommerce website. COURSE DESCRIPTION This course addresses one of three key aspects of the User eXperience of eCommerce and other websites: usability (other courses in the OUXI curriculum will address designing for persuasion and graphic design). The course is very concrete, a \"how-to\" course offering clear, actionable guidelines and hands-on exercises. These website usability guidelines are not based on subjective opinion - they have all been well established by rigorous, published research from disciplines such as cognitive science and computer-human interaction. Each guideline is fully explained and generously illustrated with many examples from real websites. The 34 design guidelines offered were selected from the full body of knowledge on web usability to be: universal (i.e., applicable to any and all websites), easy to explain, commonly violated, high impact, and easy to implement. They represent the \"low-hanging fruit\" in designing for web usability. With nothing beyond these 34 key guidelines, anyone should be able to realize major improvements in the usability of their website, which will contribute measurably to the success of the site in meeting its business goals. COURSE FORMAT The course format is a Powerpoint presentation accompanied by a studio-recorded video lecture, broken up into chapters and lectures. Downloadable course materials include the full Powerpoint presentation in two formats - full slides, and two slides per page - and an actionable, Excel-based guidelines checklist that can be used as you apply your new skills to real web projects. The course includes about 3 hours of lecture, and roughly 1.5 - 2 hours of hands-on exercises. Both quick (a couple of minutes) and more comprehensive (roughly 45 minutes) optional hands-on exercises, followed by sample exercise solutions, help reinforce your understanding of the guidelines. Your registration for this course entitles you to 30 minutes of \"office hours\" with the instructor via email. You can email questions to the instructor and receive personal responses. Send email to drdeb@ouxinstitute.com with \"OUXI D15\" in the subject line.

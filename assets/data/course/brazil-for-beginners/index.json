People rely on the internet for almost everything, information/research, streaming movies from popular services like netflix or hulu, online gaming, even with mobile phones there is a need for that faster connection. Fiber Optics is the answer! Our old copper based cabling simply wont support the speeds and data capacity needed this day in age. Big companies such as AT&T/Verizon & even the U.S. Government have invested in updating our old copper cabling to Fiber Optic Cabling. So why is it not everywhere? After investing billions in upgrading our old copper cabling to fiber cabling the communications industry realized the man power simply isn't there to install it fast enough. What does this mean? It means there are a lot of jobs out there in this field, the need for fiber optic professionals is high. I am here to teach you the basics of fiber optics. A lot of this course is based off of the curriculum I teach at the University of Riverside that gives students a CFOT(Certified Fiber Optic Technician) Certificate from the FOA(Fiber Optics Association). This course is intended for anyone who wants to learn the basics of fiber optics, maybe you are curious about the buzz around fiber optics, or maybe you are a systems administrator and IT manager that wants to gain knowledge of fiber optics.

It caresses and comforts us, provides sustenance and refreshment, is something that humanity has cherished since the beginning of history, and means something different to everyone else. Yet the historical facts and information about water remains little known. Water tells the story of changing human relationships with water over the past 10,000 years and tries to answer some basic questions: How have human attitudes to water changed since people first began to manage their water supplies? What major events in the past have defined our present relationship to water, not as something revered, but treated as an anonymous commodity? Why are we now facing a global water crisis and what are prospects for the future? This is the story of gravity and human ingenuity, of irrigation and aqueducts, of humble farming villages, ancient cities, and the rise and fall of civilizations. We draw on archaeology and hydrology, on anthropology and ancient oral traditions, on classical literature and Islamic agriculture—on a broad array of scientific inquiries in many languages and in all parts of the world. Taking this course will make you look at water in an entirely new way.

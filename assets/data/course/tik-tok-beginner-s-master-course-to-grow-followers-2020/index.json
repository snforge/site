The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"3779c8b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742128","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.096Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"YouTube (Live) For Beginners: Fast Track Training 2020","headline":"Learn how to use YouTube (Live) quickly and easily for yourself or business","description":"YouTube (Live) For Beginners is a straight to the point, step by step training course to get you started immediately.See the course subjects below:YouTube (Live) For Beginners: Fast Track Training 2020Section 1: Course Welcome & Overview1 - Overview2 - Minimum Equipment Needed for Desktop StreamingSection 2: Account Set Up3 - Equipment Not Required But Good to Have4 - More Equipment Not Required But Good To Have5 - Creating An Account6 - Channel Status and FeaturesSection 3: Setting Up Defaults7 - Setting The Upload Defaults8 - Setting Up the Branding9 - Creating an Associated WebsiteSection 4: Private Vs Unlisted Vs Public10 - Private Vs Unlisted Vs Public11 - Going Live From Your Desktop12 - Using the Events Tab13 - Advanced Info and Settings for Live Streaming14 - Google Hangout Settings15 - Google Hangout Left Margin ToolsSection 5: Start Live Streaming16 - Starting the Hangout for Live17 - Google Slides-Alternative to Using Chat18 - Re-stream For Facebook Live and YouTube Live Simultaneous Streaming19 - Streaming Through MobileSection 6: Conclusion20 - Conclusion","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2742128_c3ef_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/youtube-live-for-beginners-fast-track-training-2020/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Social Media Marketing","YouTube Audience Growth"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["377a64f8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea524-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789031-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376a5f61-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37702bc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776e285-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"you-tube-live-for-beginners-fast-track-training-2020"},{"id":"3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27830","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.943Z","updated":"2012-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Social Media Success for Photographers","headline":"Learn how to grow your Photography Business with these creative social media marketing ideas and strategies","description":"There are many photographers and photography businesses who have been utilizing social media, as part of their digital marketing strategy, to move their photography businesses forward.

There are a lot of great reasons to use online content to market your business - you can attract more traffic, establish your expertise and earn the trust that turns your website's visitors into customers. Heck, even Google changed their search engine so that sites with great content float to the top of their search results pages. However, creating content can be challenging. It takes time. Not everyone enjoys writing and many folks just don't like to write at all. Writing content for website means trouble to them! But what if there was a way to quickly and easily create the kind of content that attracts your target customers? What if you could use that content to build so much credibility, authority and trust that potential customers are driven to take action by buying your products and services, following you on social media sites and signing-up to get your newsletters? And, what if doing this was easier than what you're trying to do now? It's all possible with content curation. Content curation doesn't do away with the writing, but it does make web content writing easier to quickly create powerful content that will: ● Bring more traffic to your site ● Increase the number of your social media fans and followers ● Build your e-mail marketing list ● Establish you as a top \"go-to\" expert in your industry ● Keep you on top of your target customer's mind ● Earn you good karma (and \"social credit\") from your peers ● Increase sales What's that? You think content curation is the lazy man's way to do inbound marketing? Well, if you just listed a bunch of links, I would say that you're right. But content curation is much more than that. Content curation is all about adding value to the links you curate and this course teaches you -- using step-by-step videos, worksheets and templates -- how to do just that. The course is split into four parts: 1 Content curation overview and examples: teaches you what content curation is, why you should use it and how you can use it; 2 Creating content curated content: how to choose topics to curate, how to find and select content for each topic, how to add value to the content you find and how to construct the actual content; 3 Content curation tips-and-tricks: a couple of handy lessons on extending the value of content curation; and 4 Putting content curation into action: how to get started using content curation to start writing website content and blow up your business. But wait, there's more! I've also included a bonus video that teaches you all about inbound marketing and a content curated document which is all about content curation. The best thing about this course: You can use it to quickly create powerful content, content that brings customers to your site and drives them to take action, again and again and again and again and (well, you get the idea)... p.s. Don't know a thing about me? Here are some nice things folks have said about other courses I've created: \"Thanks for the fabulous Wordpress course.

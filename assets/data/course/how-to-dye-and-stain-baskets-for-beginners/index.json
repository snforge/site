People rely on the internet for almost everything, information/research, streaming movies from popular services like netflix or hulu, online gaming, even with mobile phones there is a need for that faster connection. Fiber Optics is the answer! Our old copper based cabling simply wont support the speeds and data capacity needed this day in age. Big companies such as AT&T/Verizon & even the U.S. Government have invested in updating our old copper cabling to Fiber Optic Cabling. So why is it not everywhere? After investing billions in upgrading our old copper cabling to fiber cabling the communications industry realized the man power simply isn't there to install it fast enough. What does this mean? It means there are a lot of jobs out there in this field, the need for fiber optic professionals is high. I am here to teach you the basics of fiber optics. A lot of this course is based off of the curriculum I teach at the University of Riverside that gives students a CFOT(Certified Fiber Optic Technician) Certificate from the FOA(Fiber Optics Association). This course is intended for anyone who wants to learn the basics of fiber optics, maybe you are curious about the buzz around fiber optics, or maybe you are a systems administrator and IT manager that wants to gain knowledge of fiber optics.

Learn why hundreds of companies, from financial services companies like Wealthfront to social companies like IMVU to large corporations such as Intuit, are using this revolutionary technique. But what is Lean Startup, or more importantly, how do I implement Lean principles into my own company? Well, to answer that question, we've brought in the Godfather of Lean Startup himself, Eric Ries. Not only has he written the book on \"The Lean Startup,\" but he has also now created THE course on Lean Startup. Eric brought in all of the leaders in the movement to talk to you about what lean startup is and how to implement it into your company. This course is the real deal - it's the most content you'll ever get on the Lean Startup in one place. More importantly, it is curated - Eric has personally taken the most important aspects of Lean Startup and condensed it into a single course. And then he added a few dozen case studies of it by including bonus material from the definitive conferences on the subject.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8467_e90b_8.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Lean Startup"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":369,"isFree":false,"matches":["376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c0d13-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f825-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-lean-startup"}]}}

First I got out the newspaper and struggled to read keeping my elbows tucked in, that failed so I got out a novel but quickly got frustrated with the pages not staying open! Ok I thought, get out the laptop and catch up on some of those pdf ebooks I downloaded last week, that was ok for about half an hour until the battery died! Anyway in all that the time, the guy sitting next to me was really quiet and seemed quite relaxed, I glanced over and he had this really slim gray tablet thing on his lap and was reading. I'd never seen this before so interrupted him to inquire. 'Oh it's my Kindle' he said, 'a what?' I asked He replied 'I have to be honest I'm not one for gadgets but I love this, my wife bought it for my birthday as I like to travel light but miss reading stuff'. 'Yea, but aren't you limited to what's available to read' I said 'Well if you call 650,000 ebooks, 9000 blogs, newspapares and magazines as well as access to my personal documents then I suppose, yes!' I was stunned, so I came back with a smart reply..'I bet the battery runs out quick and you can only read it in a darkened room though?' He replied 'Well there's up to 1 month's battery and you can read in bright sunlight because this latest Kindle's screen is 50% brighter than previous ones, also I hate technology and gadgets so this is perfect for a non-techie like me. He then asked me what I did for a living and I said 'information publisher', 'tell me the titles of some of your books and I'll see if I can find them on Amazon to download' Well this WAS embarassing - I had NOTHING published in the Amazon Kindle format and had only just heard what one was! Dollar signs were going around in my head as to how much money I was LOSING by not having anything available on Amazon Kindle. Now I'm not trying to sell you a Kindle here, but after also learning that there are now something like 4 million of these around the world if you are the same as me and have previously published ebooks or are thinking about it now then you're probably worried that you may have already MISSED THE BOAT. I am now quickly catching up on how to join in on this amazingly lucrative opportunity  and have spent the last few weeks finding out exactly what's involved in becoming a publisher on Amazon Kindle and can now share that hard work with you. I thought it would be too unfair to keep all these gold nuggets of information to myself, especially as this marketplace is HUGE and there's more than enough for EVERYONE. So you can learn IMMEDIATELY what has taken me weeks to find out and be up and running WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. I'll show you how to find profitable niches that Amazon readers love, prepare your ebook in the correct Kindle format and upload it to Amazon. Amazon Kindle stores your ebook, easily lets its readers find you, takes payment then shares the revenue with you! Once uploaded you can leave it all on autopilot or drive traffic to your sales page, sit back and rake in the money! Sales Fact: There's a HUGE demand for the Amazon Kindle. That's right...On November 19, 2007, Amazon released the Kindle First Generation. Within five and a half hours it sold out! Keep in mind that the device remained out of stock for another five months, until late April 2008. You see, another huge factor for Amazon Kindle’s growth, is it makes things easy for users. eBooks are Cheaper Users can download the first chapter of any book for free, which can increase sales. iPhone owners can buy Kindle books and read them on their phones (This is huge!) Kindle is portable and simple to use for everyone. (Made for reading...good for people that are less techy) Besides eBooks, you can read newspapers, magazines and blogs on your kindle. It’s Fast... just buy a book and it is auto-delivered wirelessly in less than one minute. And Much More Benefits for YOU, the Publisher: As you've seen from above, you have access to a massive market of readers, who want specific ebooks. Amazon Kindle has made it so easy for anyone to use their system, and because of that, the market just keeps growing. What about security? Is it safe to put your ebooks online? Yes, ebooks bought at Amazon are protected by AZW DRM. This way Kindle readers can't share your books with their friends. Problems you may face: You may have written a great Book, but you don't know how to publish it onto Amazon Kindle. You're worried it's too technical and you just don't know how to start. - How do you make your Book digital? - How do you price your eBook?- How do you promote your eBook? - How do you improve your eBook, so that it adds value and sells? If you've always dreamt about being a published author but were worried about running the gauntlet of submitting your work to publishers only to feel humiliated and rejected time after time, this is your chance to get your own back and beat the big boys at their own game! No more submitting manuscripts that you have sweat blood over\nNo more thoughts of printing your own books and advertising them yourself at huge expense and risk!\nNo more waiting for a letter or phone call, usually of rejection!

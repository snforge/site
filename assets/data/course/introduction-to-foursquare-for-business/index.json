The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund. I want you to feel confident and certain in your enrollment knowing you have nothing to lose.I'm looking forward to getting started with you.See you inside,Justin","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743158_1263_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/business-course/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Business Fundamentals"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b264-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef10-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-start-a-side-business-from-idea-to-execution-in-2020"},{"id":"37777ec0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2749442","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.041Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Réseaux sociaux","headline":"Comment utiliser les réseaux sociaux pour développer ses affaires","description":"Principes- Pourquoi les réseaux sociaux- Pourquoi utiliser les réseaux sociaux- Objectif et stratégie- Stratégie Push et Pull- Pourquoi impliquer les employés- Ce que les employés peuvent apporter- Sujets de vidéos- Comment s’assurer de la qualité du contenu- Sur quels réseaux sociaux publier quoiLes fonctions de base de Facebook- La terminologie- Ouvrir un compte Facebook- Formulaire d’inscription Facebook- Exercice : créez votre compte Facebook- Page Facebook, mur, accueil, amis, messages, commentaires- Publier- J’aime, commenter, partager- Identifier, supprimer l’identification (taguer, détaguer)- Exercice de publicationGérer son compte Facebook- Gérer les paramètres de Facebook- Facebook, comment gérer son compte- Créer une nouvelle pageDiffuser plus large sur Facebook- Les cercles concentriques de diffusion- Faire diffuser ses publications- Amis de la page personnelle- Peupler une page corpo ou évènement- Exercice pour élargir une diffusion et créer une campagneDiffuser sur d’autres pages que la sienne- Comment publier ailleurs- Chercher une page de groupe, s’inscrire- Mettre en signet les pages de publication- Diffuser les nouvelles et commenter- Commenter sur une page Facebook publique- Publier en choisissant son compte- Exercice : trouver des groupes et y publierConseils généraux d’utilisation des réseaux sociaux- Facebook : conseils pratiques d’utilisation- Conseils pour tous les réseaux sociaux- Commenter sur une autre page Facebook publique- Conseils pour tous les réseaux sociaux- Conseils généraux- Techniques de réponse- Conseils pratiques- Forums- Réponses toutes faites- Insultes graves, diffamationCampagnes de publicité Facebook- Campagnes publicitaires Facebook- Créer une publicité : bouton vert- Page gestionnaire de publicité- Créer une audience avec des paramètres- Créer une audience personnalisée- Comment créer une audience personnaliséeLinkedIn- S’inscrire sur LinkedIn- Remplir son profil LinkedIn- Nourrir son réseau LinkedIn- Peupler LinkedIn- Chercher une personne ou un groupe- Partager et rédiger un article- Écrire une nouvelle- Diffuser- Exercice- Créer une page entrepriseYouTube- Créer un compte YouTube- Les trois types de vidéos- Faites vivre vos vidéos- SujetsInstagram- Caractéristiques- Créer un compte Instagram- ExerciceTwitter- Ouvrir un compte Twitter- Comment utiliser Twitter- ExerciceCréer du contenu- Créer du contenu écrit- Exercice- Faire des photos- Exercice- Faire du contenu vidéo- ExercicePlan d’action pour vos réseaux sociaux","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749442_1534.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/reseaux-sociaux/","language":"fr","tags":["Marketing","Social Media Marketing"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776946a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3da-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37744a72-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"reseaux-sociaux"},{"id":"37736018-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"21799","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.814Z","updated":"2012-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Mobile Marketing Academy","headline":"MOBILE IS NOT JUST APPS!

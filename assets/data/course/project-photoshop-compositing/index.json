What People Are Saying \"This course was great. I thought since Elements was already pretty easy to use, I wouldn't learn much. But these videos brought my capabilities to an entirely new level.\" -J Stratlin \"I really got a lot out of these videos because of the way Jerron uses examples, instead of speeding through menus everything was clearly laid out in steps onscreen. Thank you.\" -Donica Waverly \"Just what I needed...a very nice look at the main tools...with cool sections on camera raw and panoramic merging that gave me more options even when shooting.\" -Ryan Schutto</p></p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/15104_fd2c_9.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/photoshop-elements-10/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Photoshop"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":15,"isFree":false,"matches":["377582f7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca953-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad491-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d970-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c805-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"adobe-photoshop-elements-10-made-easy"},{"id":"376ecc36-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"14766","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.588Z","updated":"2017-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Photoshop Essentials","headline":"Gain massive skills and learn a ton of Photoshop techniques!","description":" Delve head-long into the world of Photoshop with expert video trainer, artist, and designer Geoff Blake in this massive 14-plus hour, 2-disc DVD set!

Photoshop is now a household word, and with good reason. It can make washed-out imperfect images into digital masterpieces, or even take decades-old photos and repair damages that have been there for years. Professional technology trainer Andy Anderson will show you how to get professional results, with the same straightforward teaching approach he used in seminars for Disney and The White House in this Photoshop CS5 Tutorial that will inspire and inform.This Adobe Photoshop CS5 for Photographers course goes through techniques that are tried and true, and used by professionals everywhere to touch up and enhance digital and scanned photography. This tutorial is not for the beginner to Photoshop. You should have at least a basic working knowledge of Photoshop and the tools that are available. Starting with a basic introduction to the fundamental photography concepts of ISO, Depth of Field and Shutter Speed, you will quickly discover that this video tutorial covers more than correcting red-eye, although it does that too, but it also is rife with techniques that photographers can use both in Photoshop, and before you even take the picture with your camera. When combined with the Photoshop for Beginners tutorial course, you will have an impressive range of knowledge of the program and a specific expertise when it comes to working with photos after learning these Photoshop Actions for Photographers.

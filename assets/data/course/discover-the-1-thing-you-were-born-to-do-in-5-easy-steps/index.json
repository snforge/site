Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},"related":[{"id":"377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742994","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.149Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn The Power Of Self-Discipline","headline":"How to be self-disciplined in order to gain success in every aspect of your life","description":"Self-discipline is not a neat little trait that we can choose to have.

Stand Out and be HAPPY","headline":"Polish your communication skills by learning simple techniques + easy adjustments to your mind, voice + body.","description":"Imagine this:  Charming everyone at that networking eventSpeaking up at the staff meeting to share your Big Idea (which everyone loves, by the way)Chatting (effortlessly!) with your boss at the water coolerActually enjoying the prospect of a blind date - you know he'll think you're hilariousMeeting your girlfriend's family and (obviously) befriending all of themReturning happy from big events - not exhausted or worrying about the impression you made It's totally, 100% possible.Feeling confident + comfortable in big groups, speaking up + being heard, hitting it off with people you just met - these aren't experiences that are reserved for special people. Anybody (yes, really - anybody) can learn to do these things. Being able to speak with confidence is a skill that translates to absolutely every aspect of your life - making presentations to your team, networking at professional conferences, big family holidays, dating, interviewing for new jobs. How you feel and speak about yourself directly affects your career, your personal life, and your self-esteem.  This course teaches you simple techniques and easy adjustments that (slowly, gradually) lead to big results.  If you've tried Toastmasters (too public) or books (too boring) this course is for you. With fun, engaging videos, you can learn at your own pace, on your own time, in your own home - and review whenever you need a refresher or a pep talk.  You're fantastic. I know it and I'm pretty sure you know it. I invite you to step up and claim the things you deserve - the promotions, the new clients, the fun friends. You can start here.  Enroll now!  I can't wait to meet you.  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8849_cc40_16.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/speak-up/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Communications","Public Speaking"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":361,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749890-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef16-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef14-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"speak-up-stand-out-and-be-happy"}]}}

The yoga classes were hard for me at first, but I was amazed by the progress I made. I set a goal to achieve ‘full wheel pose’ by the end of the program, which I was not too sure I’d accomplish… Not only did I accomplish my goals I set, I exceeded them!Now I can walk by a mirror with pride in my body for the first time in many years. I made a ton of new friends and discovered a new passion for yoga. Thank you so much Dashama!\" ~Chris, Alabama, USA \"Upon starting the 30 day challenge I thought of Yoga as an easy way to strengthen the core without high impact cardio. Incredible how wrong I was. Although it is these things I came to realize very quickly it is SO MUCH MORE! In the first month of the program I learned so much about where my body was at, where I wanted it to be, what it could and could not do, what it should be able to do, as well as why I was not feeling well. The pounds shed off of me, every day was an amazing renewal of body, mind, and spirit. I woke up feeling refreshed and excited. My body was sore one week and limber the next! Asanas that I could not conquer one day were becoming more and more a part of my every day actions. My hair began to grow out long and lush. My skin began to clear up and glow. My muscles began to tone and even my self confidence and mental well being heightened! I then began to practice mediation and yoga every day. I learned about breathing, how it starts and ends each and every day, and where it can take and keep you!” ~Shannon, USA “This program has helped me to refocus and, though I wasn’t able to complete all 30 days, it made me very mindful of what was going on or why I wasn’t doing the yoga on the days that I missed. And I felt very off when I didn’t practice. The feelings that I get when I was taking the time to do yoga are addicting and I just want to keep doing the videos and keep improving! I’m telling everybody that will listen about what a difference it has made and send them to your website!” ~Jessica M.

Studying the chakras separately one day at a time breaks down the information so the depth of each can be easily digested. This Chakras for Beginners course will show you how effective consistent practice with clear intention can be for finding and keeping peace. Studying the energy within guides you to find a deeper understanding of yourself. Following my instruction you will learn what the chakras are and how focusing on balancing chakra will bring you greater self-understanding, self-confidence, and less stress. So what is a chakra? The term chakra translates to wheel or disk. Within our body there are seven major chakras, which can be thought of as energy centers. Each chakra correlates to our levels of consciousness, from the most primitive to transcendent. The seven chakras are: Muladhara (root), Svadhisthana (sweetness), Manipura (lustrious gem), Anahata (unstuck), Vissudha (purification), Ajna (Command Center), and Sahasara (thousand fold). The first chakra starts with the most primitive level of consciousness and gradually develops until you reach the seventh chakra and highest level of consciousness. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18273_8928_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-the-chakras/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":3.7,"reviews":5,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742363-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"7-day-yoga-routine-increase-energy-and-balance-your-chakras"},{"id":"37711620-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17789","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.604Z","updated":"2012-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"The Yoga Of Laughter: From Stressed Out To Blissed Out!","headline":"This simple, fun and laughter-filled Yogic practice will help you achieve emotional detox and personal empowerment.","description":"Has life become too serious for you? Do you find yourself going days or weeks without laughing? I certainly used to. I was in a job I hated and that filled my head with negativity and my body with rigidity. In 1998 while in Mumbai, India, I read a newspaper article about a group of people that gathered every day in a nearby public park to laugh. It piqued my interest because they shared no jokes and didn't use any form of comedy. Instead they laughed purely for the sake of feeling good, just because. I was puzzled but chose not to go and investigate. It would have taken a full one hour, and I was too busy complaining I was too busy. I mean, why would sane adults do this anyway? What was the point? This was ridiculous and they had to be crazy. Anybody can laugh like that. Ha ha ha. Done. I quickly forgot about it all, and was so convinced I could laugh anytime anywhere that it took me 6 years to realize that I never did. Eventually my heart took me back to Mumbai and its laughter clubs. I learned to laugh every day as a yogic practice using an exercise regime created by a medical doctor in 1995 called Laughter Yoga. This was a big turning point for me. I discovered how good laughing could make me feel and how easy it was to laugh, even when everything in my life seemed to be going astray. It was so profound that it triggered a cataclysmic reaction in my brain. The mask fell. I stopped being who I thought I should be and started being who I really wanted to be. I learned to always take full responsibility for my actions and how they made me feel. This did not change my life. It still is much better than that. It changed me. The more I practiced and taught this exercise regime, the more I discovered complementary techniques that help to bring joy into everyday life. I also started to understand the underlying wisdom from both the East and the West that all these techniques pointed to. In time I combined this knowledge into a method that I call Laughter Wellness. It includes the Laughter Yoga approach of simulated laughter exercises, and expands its approach by offering a clear process that is easy to follow, and adding a greater variety of techniques and activities, insights, games, dances, songs and more – all glued together with lots of laughter. What's in it for you This introductory course will introduce to you the founding principles and key techniques of Laughter Yoga and the Laughter Wellness method, and how they can help you as an individual laugh more (we won't go into how to teach group sessions). It will remind you of the scientifically proven benefits of laughter. These are still best summarized by the quote in King James Bible \"A merry heart does good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.\" (Proverbs 17:22) It will help you remember how easy it is to laugh, and how good it can make you feel. You will learn many ways and techniques to create and maintain a personal and daily laughter practice. It will show you how to use laughter as a skillset to maintain a positive attitude even in the face of adversity, and redefine stress as a challenge, not a threat. It will share valuable insights on how to best use the power of your mind with the actions of your body to add more laughter and joy into your life, as well as become a better version of who you are. It will share valuable insights on how to achieve a healthy, happy and successful life from the ancient wisdom of Yoga and modern scientific findings from the world of positive psychology. Course requirements No particular equipment, clothing, or physical abilities are required. What your personal history is doesn't matter. Who you are now is perfect and most appropriate. All can practice and benefit, with or without limbs, because this method revolves primarily around the breath and attitude (it's of course going to be more fun if you have limbs because these allow for more movements.) All you need is a big smile and the willingness to try something new that only adds and doesn't take anything away. This is a \"yes, and\" approach to life, not \"yes, but.\" My goal is not to persuade you of anything, but rather to make you conscious of what is available to you. As Zig Ziglar once said, \"no man is clever enough to remember everything he knows.\" There is always value in being reminded of what's important.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/17789_c1d8_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/laughter/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":4.8,"reviews":12,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad490-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742363-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736017-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711627-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-yoga-of-laughter-from-stressed-out-to-blissed-out"},{"id":"376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"8422","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.171Z","updated":"2012-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Kundalini Yoga to Heal Stress and Anxiety by Valinda~Viriam","headline":"Kundalini Yoga is an ancient & highly effective yoga that transforms a person quickly & effectively in just 30 minutes!","description":"Kundalini Yoga is an ancient and highly effective yoga that transforms a person quickly and effectively.  In this course you will be guided by Valinda-Viriam MA, E-RYT an Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher (with over 20,000 hours plus 19 years teaching) certified in Kundalini and Hatha Yoga at the advanced levels.  She has a Master's degree in Dance/Movement Therapy from UCLA and worked as a therapist for many years.You will learn simple and effective tools to practice in your daily life in as little as 30 minutes a day to transform stress, anxiety, and depression to calm, centered, peaceful feelings.There are 5 Kundalini Yoga sessions in this course.  Each session is about 30 minutes.  The first session starts with Kundalini Yoga Basics then progresses with more challenging poses.

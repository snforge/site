There are a lot of great reasons to use online content to market your business - you can attract more traffic, establish your expertise and earn the trust that turns your website's visitors into customers. Heck, even Google changed their search engine so that sites with great content float to the top of their search results pages. However, creating content can be challenging. It takes time. Not everyone enjoys writing and many folks just don't like to write at all. Writing content for website means trouble to them! But what if there was a way to quickly and easily create the kind of content that attracts your target customers? What if you could use that content to build so much credibility, authority and trust that potential customers are driven to take action by buying your products and services, following you on social media sites and signing-up to get your newsletters? And, what if doing this was easier than what you're trying to do now? It's all possible with content curation. Content curation doesn't do away with the writing, but it does make web content writing easier to quickly create powerful content that will: ● Bring more traffic to your site ● Increase the number of your social media fans and followers ● Build your e-mail marketing list ● Establish you as a top \"go-to\" expert in your industry ● Keep you on top of your target customer's mind ● Earn you good karma (and \"social credit\") from your peers ● Increase sales What's that? You think content curation is the lazy man's way to do inbound marketing? Well, if you just listed a bunch of links, I would say that you're right. But content curation is much more than that. Content curation is all about adding value to the links you curate and this course teaches you -- using step-by-step videos, worksheets and templates -- how to do just that. The course is split into four parts: 1 Content curation overview and examples: teaches you what content curation is, why you should use it and how you can use it; 2 Creating content curated content: how to choose topics to curate, how to find and select content for each topic, how to add value to the content you find and how to construct the actual content; 3 Content curation tips-and-tricks: a couple of handy lessons on extending the value of content curation; and 4 Putting content curation into action: how to get started using content curation to start writing website content and blow up your business. But wait, there's more! I've also included a bonus video that teaches you all about inbound marketing and a content curated document which is all about content curation. The best thing about this course: You can use it to quickly create powerful content, content that brings customers to your site and drives them to take action, again and again and again and again and (well, you get the idea)... p.s. Don't know a thing about me? Here are some nice things folks have said about other courses I've created: \"Thanks for the fabulous Wordpress course. You put together a goldmine of information that has taken me from a mystified WordPress \"do it myselfer\" to someone who now knows exactly how to achieve the look I want.\" -- Darlene S., WordPress for Artists customer \"When I was looking for freelance writing jobs in 2010, Matt provided an affordable and downloadable course that has helped me find part-time work since Day 1.\" -- Ben T., Earn More by Finding Freelance Writing Jobs Online customer \"If I was new to the web and wanted to make money writing, I would kiss Matt’s feet for this resource.

Learn how, as a freelancer working from home, I get 1,000 visitors a day. SEO easy!","description":"SEO beginner? Let me show you how to get high ranking in searches by learning the basics of search engine optimization. It's SEO easy!In this course, I show you how I get 1,000 visitors a day - that's a third of a million people a year. And it's not the mythical 'hits' that some people boast about. These are real live humans.AND IF YOU ARE A WEB DESIGNER, APPLICATION DEVELOPER, FREELANCER, THIS COULDN'T BE MORE APPROPRIATE. YOU ARE SELLING TO EXACTLY THE SAME AUDIENCE I SELL TO. And I did all the search engine optimization myself. I don't pretend to be an SEO guru. In fact, I hate technology, but I realized some time ago that your rankings in Google searches are too valuable to entrust to others. There's no need to spend a fortune with SEO companies when you can achieve astounding results yourself - without any technical expertise. After all, no-one knows your business like you do, and no one can be as highly motivated.Does it work?These are the results of some of my key phrase Google rankings (PS I am a copywriter)IT Copywriter - position number one out of over 13 million competing sitesBrochure Copywriter - top position out of 375,000 competing sitesWhite Paper Copywriter - number one out of 233,000 sitesLogistics Copywriter - top out of half a million siteCopy and PasteIn this search engine optimization training course, there's no sales hype. I just lift the kimono and show you exactly what I did to my own site – and you can do exactly the same to your site – just 'copy and paste'. And, yes, it does take into account the latest changes that Google has made to its ranking algorithm.A jargon-free zoneWe start very gently, taking a bite at a time. In the entire course there are just six hard-core jargon words (I couldn't avoid those). They are search engine optimization basics, so they are easy to understand. The rest is pure layman's language. Each video introduces a new concept and is followed by a downloadable pdf, so you have a hard copy and can add notes of your own.Oh – and I am very accessible. Any queries, or anything not clear, just email me.I am here to help.WARNING: If you are already proficient at SEO, this course is NOT for you. It's not for 'techies', so you will be disappointed and frustrated. It is intended for people like me, too occupied running my business to want to get down to the minutia. I just want top ratings – and that's what I get.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/12196_c290_13.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/search-engine-optimization-made-easy/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","SEO"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":531,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376a5f60-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376fdda0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"seo-beginners-how-i-get-1-000-visitors-a-day-with-seo"},{"id":"376de1d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"11922","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.176Z","updated":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"How to Create a Successful WordPress Site","headline":"Learn how to create an awesome WordPress site and a bunch of cool tricks to drive traffic to make it super successful!","description":"Ok, so want to promote your business online but first you need to get a nice looking website up and running.

This includes all levels of energy in and around the body with special emphasis on the meridian and chakra systems. Several polarity balancing techniques are discussed and shown with detailed illustrations. Eastern medicine and applied kinesiology (muscle testing) form the basis of energy psychology. This course is useful for both the lay person who wishes to learn the basics of energy psychology and is essential for professionals. The exciting field of energy psychology is only 30 years old. Although not well known, it is one of the fastest growing techniques in psychology. This is due to the amazingly quick and painless results that people experience with energy therapists. These techniques have proven more effective than traditional cognitive, talk therapy for addictions, phobias, obsessions, depression, anxiety, and especially Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Its originator, Dr. Roger Callahan, first formulated his school of energy psychology in the late 1970s. His schema consists of tapping on the acupoints of the body in particular sequences that he feels is necessary to relieve depression, anxiety, addictions, and other mental health problems.  He has validated his technique through many research studies where TFT was shown to perform much better than many other psychological techniques such as cognitive therapy. This course investigates Thought Field Therapy in lecture form and video demonstrations. It is suitable for both the lay person and clinicians. Developed by Gary Craig, Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT is the best known and most popular school of energy psychology. EFT is essentially an offshoot of Thought Field Therapy (TFT). EFT is a simple, quick and painless technique that can be used without a therapist's assistance, making EFT the perfect self-help technique.

Studying the chakras separately one day at a time breaks down the information so the depth of each can be easily digested. This Chakras for Beginners course will show you how effective consistent practice with clear intention can be for finding and keeping peace. Studying the energy within guides you to find a deeper understanding of yourself. Following my instruction you will learn what the chakras are and how focusing on balancing chakra will bring you greater self-understanding, self-confidence, and less stress. So what is a chakra? The term chakra translates to wheel or disk. Within our body there are seven major chakras, which can be thought of as energy centers. Each chakra correlates to our levels of consciousness, from the most primitive to transcendent. The seven chakras are: Muladhara (root), Svadhisthana (sweetness), Manipura (lustrious gem), Anahata (unstuck), Vissudha (purification), Ajna (Command Center), and Sahasara (thousand fold). The first chakra starts with the most primitive level of consciousness and gradually develops until you reach the seventh chakra and highest level of consciousness. ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/18273_8928_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-the-chakras/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":3.7,"reviews":5,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742363-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b52-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"7-day-yoga-routine-increase-energy-and-balance-your-chakras"}]}}

If you want to learn internet marketing, if you're looking to build a business that has a real consistent, dependable income but have been struggling to make money online so far, then YES you're in the right place... You may or may not like everything you read on this page and some of it may sting a little, but I've never been ones to tell the truth with a sugar coating... Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... And here it is, it's the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) But why is that? Surely if everyone's buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest '1 click to riches' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn't they? Why are there so many people failing? Think about it like this... Most marketers aren't lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? Well here's the cold, hard truth: Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap 'systems' that don't work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass 'gurus' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it's not your fault. It's simply the nature of the industry. But look - If you've found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no \"magic bullet\". You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works! And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - And that's why I'm so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you'll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it's all geared up to you finally getting the results you've always wanted FAST! Inside you'll get a complete system: ● You'll know exactly what business to start ● How to get an unlimited amount of free traffic. ● How to create killer evergreen products that are guaranteed to sell ● How to attract partners that will allow your business to grow really really fast ● How to put your business on autopilot ● And how to scale your business to any income level that you desire. By the time you finish this internet marketing course you’ll have learnt internet marketing and you'll own a ROCK SOLID, profitable business. Your only decision will be to keep it or sell it. Seriously you'll have a real asset, an asset that's worth selling for a lump sum of money. How would you like a thirty thousand dollar payday? What would you do with that much cash? Think about this right now: What's it worth to you to have the skill to build a business that could produce that type of money on demand... ... Or to own a profitable evergreen business, the type of business that we described earlier (high traffic website, thousands of subscribers, powerful JV partners and relationships) Something that provides you with the total freedom to live the life you choose... What are you waiting for... below you'll find we are giving away almost an entire hour of this course's life changing videos.

Also included is a complete database of websites to use for your online marketing campaign as well as a basic online marketing plan for any small business. The videos range in length from one minute to approximately nine minutes and are divided into two categories: lecture style and hands-on. The lecture style videos feature the course founder, Tom Aikins, explaining the principles of a particular subject. Then, the hands-on videos that immediately follow these videos show step-by-step how the particular technique or application is done using a screen capture program. These videos show viewers where to click and exactly what to do as the particular operation is being demonstrated and they can view the instructor’s computer screen exactly as it appears so the learning process is simple and easy to follow. This product, in following with Google’s continuing attempts to more and more engage small business owners, was created for people who have small- to medium-sized businesses and have a website that is not effective in generating sales for them. The types of business that can benefit from the OME course is almost limitless. Covering service businesses, professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc), retailers, food service, manufacturing and any others that need more traffic from their website, the OME training course can help any of these businesses improve their website traffic. And please don't forget that this includes a database of websites that are critical for use in online marketing. The cost of compiling this database yourself would be greater than the cost of the entire course. Updates to the database will also be sent to subscribers as new websites are found and tested.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/14728_4e83_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/online-marketing-excellence/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722798-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"online-marketing-excellence"},{"id":"376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"11331","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.177Z","updated":"2017-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"SEO Training Course by Moz","headline":"Learn SEO tips and tricks in this SEO training course from Moz","description":" SEO is the active practice of optimizing a web site by improving internal and external aspects in order to increase the traffic the site receives from search engines. Firms that practice SEO can vary; some have a highly specialized focus, while others take a more broad and general approach. Optimizing a web site for search engines can require looking at so many unique elements that many practitioners of SEO (SEOs) consider themselves to be in the broad field of website optimization (since so many of those elements intertwine).

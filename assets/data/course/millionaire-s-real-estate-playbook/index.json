The Psychology Of Entrepreneur Success","description":"Start a business this 2020. Learn The Psychology Of Entrepreneur SuccessDo you have dreams of going after a creative pursuit or maybe starting a business you've always wanted to start?Why are some people able to confidently take action on the things they want to do in life versus others who just keep it an idea? Well, a couple of months ago I had an idea to build an arcade machine. In fact, I wanted to manufacture a bunch and start a little side business. At that point, I knew nothing about arcade machines, how to build them, wire them up, code them, or who I could even sell them to. It was only an idea.But, fast forward only a couple months later I was able to actually turn that idea into a business that produced full-time income. This wasn't the first time I've done this either.I was able to do this because I'm aware of the psychological hurdles we all have that keep us overthinking and stuck in our heads.  And how to blast through them.The thing is I'm not special or unique in any way that you're not. This is very much a learned awareness that usually comes with experience, but can also be taught. This is why I've been able to coach others to start a business of their own regardless of their industry, interest or idea. This course is a collection of the psychological insights that action takers are aware of to help them:Take rapid action towards their goalsMake decisions without fear and hesitationUtilize motivation and opportunities when the time is rightManage risk and make intelligent choices in starting a businessGet out of their heads and actually build momentum   Think about if you were able to do that right now. Well, in just a few short lectures we can move the needle on your goals and give you the awareness you need to start taking more action today in starting a business.As with all of my courses, there's a full money-back guarantee, so if the content wasn't for you, please contact Udemy and ask for a refund.

Your old-school promotion isn’t producing results, which doesn’t surprise you since you just read in the Harvard Business Review that traditional marketing is dead. And that’s not really news either, because you keep hearing about how people are trusting traditional advertising less and less and trusting peer/social recommendations more and more. You’ve tried growing your business with \"the aggregators,\" but a lot of those leads are low quality, all of them are \"cold\" by nature, and the prices for those services just keep going up. Size of Sphere = Size of Income? So, you find yourself in this place where you’ve maxed out your sphere of influence using traditional methods. And anyone who’s been in real estate longer than 5 minutes knows that the size of your sphere determines the size of your income. More connections = more money, right? New Life for Your Business And you think, “Those old, cold and expensive methods just aren’t working for me. I need to find a new way to expand my network and inject new life into my business.” And so, for all those reasons, you decide to give Twitter a try. And here’s what you discover: That Twitter users are the most active and dynamic in all of Social Media  That you can use keywords and laser-focused geo-targeting to connect with people right in your community That there’s not a lot of competition, because most people do the wrong things, get no results and blame Twitter for the lackluster ROI - when in reality the problem wasn't Twitter at all, but simply those people doing the wrong things That Twitter is exploding, and there are now nearly HALF A BILLION people using the platform Grow Your Network So, you start connecting with more and more people, growing your network every single day. You quickly realize that Twitter users love to engage and make new connections. And you discover a few things that you did not expect. That the learning curve is not that steep. And that Twitter is actually fun. Yes, FUN! You nurture along hundreds of relationships, building and building a little bit more each and every week. And you wake up one day and realize that you’ve expanded your network dramatically while doing 99% of it at home in front of your computer. Or from your smart phone or you iPad. And you realize that what you heard was actually true: that Twitter really is the greatest relationship creation machine of all time. And you think, \"I only wish I had started using Twitter sooner.\" Take this course and let me show you how to grow your sphere of influence using Twitter....

It's true, most have warnings saying that the value of what  you buy can go down as well as up.  So when I mention domain name  speculation you will either think of people buying domain names for  crazy amounts of money then losing their shirts, or others buying domain  names really cheaply then making a killing buy selling a well known  name to a big conglomerate.We're not talking about 'cyber-squatting' here where you buy a domain only to try to blackmail  someone into paying you a high ransom for it. Big companies with  protected trademarks can easily make you get down on your knees and hand  trademarked names for nothing! Well, these are both extreme views, just  like other forms of speculation if you learn the right tricks and  techniques and don't try to 'reinvent the wheel' you have just as much  as the next person to make some good money.Of course, to achieve this you have to do some homework, you don't just want to run up to the  table and throw away all your money on one bet! The most successful  speculators study the markets, plan carefully and don't expose  themselves to unnecessary risks.  They put together a balanced portfolio  based on various markets and risks associated with them.With domain name speculation you can do the same, for example don't choose  domain names associated with just one market or niche, ie travel agents  and hotels, garages and car sales. If you study the markets you can  build up a nice portfolio based on a cross-section of markets. Decide  what kind of domains to buy, for example.com.org.info etc Sometimes a  domain name with a hyphens can be good, a keyword rather than a company  name etc.Also timing is another factor to take into account, if you find what you think is a good name, it may well be that a new  version is coming out soon like.mobi so perhaps that's a good time to  sell them on and put your money into some new names rather than keep  hanging on for the 'big one' Don't just rely on the information provided  by the seller, if you take the time it's really easy to gather convert  information that isn't really obvious when you come across a domain that  looks 'too good to be true'So don't get carried away before you do your homework, be level-headed about your speculation and don't rush  into a deal. There are some good places to do your research and homework  as well as auction sites to buy and sell. Domain name speculation can  be very rewarding and profitable, done the right way, it can be a  long-term business through all types of economic situations too as long  as you don't see it as making a 'quick buck' Although there are many  people investing in this area, it's nowhere near as competitive  as  other ares of speculation and if you take the time to educate yourself  with the right knowledge and use the correct tools, this could be a  serious long-term business for you.

This class is intended for students who have already learned some basic pattern making skills are seeking alternative methods to create more advanced patterns. The starting point is a hand inked pattern, so drawing and inking is essential and the hope is you have something in-hand to practice with. Having basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is an asset and I will try to clearly explain all the steps as we proceed. The process can be intimidating at first, but using these techniques make it much easier.This course will arm you with all the knowledge necessary. This alternative pattern-making skillset is an ideal competence if you are fabric designer, illustrator or surface pattern designer, or simply a graphic designer on a mission to create a self-sustaining career. Many insights about designing will be shared and hopefully they can inspire you to take a look at your current pattern designs and have you planning many different projects in the future.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746622_f3d3_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/blending-traditional-with-digital-techniques-in-pattern-making/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Graphic Design","Surface Pattern Design"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3773872a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b54-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f822-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779efc3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b59-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733907-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"blending-traditional-and-digital-techniques-in-pattern-making"},"related":[{"id":"3779efc3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742866","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.096Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Creating Custom Grunge Brushes In Photoshop","headline":"Experiment with textures, filters, and layer blend modes.","description":"The main ideas are to have a textured source and to play around with filters that manipulate the look of sketched-out lines and doodles.Tutorial segments are as follows:IntroductionPreparing the watercolor paper.  (You can download the attached watercolor paper from this segment.)      Applying the watercolor texture.Photo texture part one.

Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"37729cc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"20945","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.811Z","updated":"2019-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Digital Photoshop Compositing For Advertising Campaigns","headline":"This Adobe Photoshop Compositing Course will teach a Beginner Photoshop user to Master Digital Photoshop Compositing.","description":"*** New Update 05 November 2019 ***Great for Photoshop Intermediate Users \"Making Photoshop Fun & Easy\"Good to have some photoshop knowledge or experience.Full lifetime access to the complete course & updates.

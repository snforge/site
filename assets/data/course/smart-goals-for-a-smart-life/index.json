Course updated September 10 2014. WARNING - This course POLARIZES people: You'll either LOVE it or HATE it as the reviews will show you! 5-Star: 'Insightful, Helpful, Practical, Optimistic and Holistic' As for the words I used above, I like the fact that it is easy to understand yet maintains great depth. If you are someone who is suffering from depression or anxiety - whatever it may be, you will likely find this incredibly helpful. If you feel your fine, you'll still find this interesting and hopefully worthwhile. Better yet, not only for you, but for others you may know. All in all, I find the message here, uniquely, and heavily related to the messages to many of the figures I admire. There is much that can be said, but it is for you to experience and come up with a conclusion. I'm sure it will be worth your while. Honestly, I found this message to be a fantastic and important gift. I'm glad it's here free. - Brian 5-Star: Great program to make you think Its a great program that makes you think and see what it is that is really holding you back. No the question is what are you going to do about it after you've completed the course. - Mirko 1-Star: rubbish this guy sounds like a total looney freak with an IQ level of a biscuite... you sure you should be teaching about genius? couldnt handle listening to more than half of the first lecture. - Pouya Interesting huh? So what's in the course? And why does it divide opinion so much? Tom Cassidy asks Richard Wilkins, the founder of the UK's Ministry of Inspiration , to sum up his thoughts on 'Being a Genius v. Accessing Genius'. Richard explains his system that allows ordinary people to access the genius that is available to us all. It explains what it really means to 'be' a genius, and why most people who are thought of as geniuses end up being somewhat disappointing as we find out more about them. It also enables us to deal with all the 'yeah but...' beliefs that our own internal programmings throw up at us, and it allows us to be comfortable doing great things, without having to then live with the epithet 'genius'. In our experience of delivering this message to people, we've found that a lot of people won't like the simplicity of the message, they won't dare to believe that they have the power to access genius themselves and they will resent the ease with which its methods appear to work. You see, if it really IS this simple then it takes away people's excuses for not doing it. And people might not like that very much. Anyway, Take this free “Access Your Genius” course, see what all the fuss is about and learn how to become a genius yourself. the world is waiting...

If you want to learn internet marketing, if you're looking to build a business that has a real consistent, dependable income but have been struggling to make money online so far, then YES you're in the right place... You may or may not like everything you read on this page and some of it may sting a little, but I've never been ones to tell the truth with a sugar coating... Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... And here it is, it's the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) But why is that? Surely if everyone's buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest '1 click to riches' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn't they? Why are there so many people failing? Think about it like this... Most marketers aren't lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? Well here's the cold, hard truth: Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap 'systems' that don't work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass 'gurus' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it's not your fault. It's simply the nature of the industry. But look - If you've found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no \"magic bullet\". You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works! And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - And that's why I'm so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you'll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it's all geared up to you finally getting the results you've always wanted FAST! Inside you'll get a complete system: ● You'll know exactly what business to start ● How to get an unlimited amount of free traffic. ● How to create killer evergreen products that are guaranteed to sell ● How to attract partners that will allow your business to grow really really fast ● How to put your business on autopilot ● And how to scale your business to any income level that you desire. By the time you finish this internet marketing course you’ll have learnt internet marketing and you'll own a ROCK SOLID, profitable business. Your only decision will be to keep it or sell it. Seriously you'll have a real asset, an asset that's worth selling for a lump sum of money. How would you like a thirty thousand dollar payday? What would you do with that much cash? Think about this right now: What's it worth to you to have the skill to build a business that could produce that type of money on demand... ... Or to own a profitable evergreen business, the type of business that we described earlier (high traffic website, thousands of subscribers, powerful JV partners and relationships) Something that provides you with the total freedom to live the life you choose...

Over 75,000 students CURRENTLY enrolled! So, you might ask - what's the fuss all about? Well, there are two reasons people seem to like it: 1. Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) 2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively. You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. Why? How? Really? Yes, and it's all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) So, do you ever ask yourself, \"I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?\" Let's face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You've got a copy of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' on your bookshelf, you know it's a great book yet you haven't opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you've not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you're still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It's pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don't have an iron will. I don't even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I'm honest. Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn't really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just 'have more self-discipline', just 'get better'. That's why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn't even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. So, you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So, instead of increasing our willpower, let's use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We're still going to have to do the work, it's just that we won't have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I'm not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We're afraid that we won't stick at things because that's what we've done in the past. We're afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we'd rather not try. We're afraid we're not good enough. We're afraid we don't have enough willpower. We're not afraid of doing the work, we're afraid that our work won't work! So, the big question is what's going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you're ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... ________________ Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and 'Thought Engineer', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. The system takes 'One thing at a time' to a new level: it's monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you've ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! It's basically the shizzle is what I'm saying...

The course also describes the relationship between service functionality and successful customer outcomes, the principles of measuring and managing the customer's level of satisfaction with the service experience, and how these form the basis for defining problems, and responding to these through a continuous improvement program embedded within the service excellence system component of the service management framework.The Universal Service Management Body of Knowledge (USMBOK) is a series of reference publication used by professionals within a service provider organization or service business to design a systematic method for managing services.The USMBOK is a proud member of the International Best Practice Library, alongside the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge), and ITIL® (IT Infrastructure Library).","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/28951_0d50_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-usmbok-foundation-accelerator/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Operations","Management Skills"],"rating":2.4,"reviews":2,"isFree":false,"matches":["37716449-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e5701-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720086-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716443-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b745-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770998-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab314-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b266-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"service-management-fundamentals-also-usmboktm-foundation"},{"id":"377757b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2749258","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.041Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Planification stratégique","headline":"Comment planifier le succès de votre entreprise","description":"Planification stratégique- Tableau du plan stratégique globalStratégie Marketing- Tableau du plan marketing et comment il s’imbrique dans le plan stratégiqueMarketing web- Les stratégies marketing push et pull, Inbound et Outbound- Les moyens du marketing web- Le marketing web selon la connaissance du produit par les consommateurs- Les réseaux sociaux- Campagnes de bannières et remarketing- Référencement naturel ou SEO, être à la première place dans Google- Campagnes de Adwords- KPIs : mesures clés par action marketing, l’observation dans le plan marketing- Tableau de synthèse du marketing web","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749258_5617.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/planification-strategique/","language":"fr","tags":["Business","Management","Marketing Plan"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf771-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776946a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef17-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"planification-strategique"},{"id":"3776946a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27562","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.943Z","updated":"2019-03-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Social Media For Business Strategy","headline":"Create a compelling mix with the latest Social Media Strategies.

This course will concentrate on Technical Analysis, and you will learn everything I know about correctly reading stock charts in about 80 minutes!  By training yourself to read and correctly interpret the information charts give you, you will be able to predict which way a stock will most likely move in the near future.  Charts can actually give you a glimpse of the future, and are a must have tool in the successful trader's arsenal.In my Beginners Guide to Technical Analysis of Stock Charts here on Udemy, I covered fifty different technical indicators.  In this course, I teach the one indicator I use for all of my Buy and Sell Signals, and it's accuracy rate is about 80%. Two of the most important lessons included in this course are how to handle a false Buy Signal to keep losses to an absolute minimum, and when to lock in profits to maximize your gains. The trading strategy I teach in this course will provide you with a plan for entering and exiting trades with confidence. I look forward to helping you to become a successful Trader!Happy Trading! Tom  ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2762_231c_20.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/swing-trading-the-stock-market/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Finance","Swing Trading"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":349,"isFree":false,"matches":["37722790-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab310-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b0a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb77-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37797a91-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377757ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37790564-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769468-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"simple-strategy-for-swing-trading-the-stock-market"}]}}

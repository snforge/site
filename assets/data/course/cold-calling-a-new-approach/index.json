What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find &quot;the pivot&quot;- the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling. And, more critically, that they can find their market before they run out of money.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1769_95c2_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-lean-startup-debunking-myths-of-entrepreneurship/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Entrepreneurship","Lean Startup"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":626,"isFree":true,"matches":["377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf774-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ef340-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37755be1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-lean-startup-talk-at-stanford-e-corner"}]}}

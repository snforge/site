Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"377582f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"25998","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.888Z","updated":"2013-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Create a Budget that Works","headline":"Learn how to make a personal budget a practical, approach in 5 easy steps using tools that are adaptable for life.","description":"\"Creating a Personal Budget: How to Make a Personal Budget\" guides you through a five-step process, using transformative tools and concepts, for finally developing a spending plan that works for you and incorporates all those various financial puzzle pieces that make up your personal financial world.

I know how you feel but I found out how to land your dream job.","description":"\" To anyone who wants to enjoy a career in IT\" My name is Paul Browning and I worked as a police officer in the UK from 1988 to 2000. While I enjoyed the job immensely I felt I wanted to take on a new challenge, I already had an interest in computers. I had attended an course on PC assembly and learned a little bit about computer networking. I started to study for some Microsoft exams and began to apply for jobs in the IT industry. I landed a helpdesk job but as you can imagine, I quickly became bored doing password resets. I studied hard and passed some more exams and then got a role doing network support for Cisco systems in the UK. I later left to start my own IT company offering training and consulting services to companies both in the UK and internationally. I sold the company in 2008 and now run an online Cisco training company. During the time I trained students I helped many hundreds of them get their break into a career in IT. I watched them move from helpdesk roles into networking and often into freelance consulting contracts or even their own companies. I’ve also worked with hundreds of IT managers who have shared with me the things they look for when looking to hire IT staff for their companies. I’ve even been through the process myself when I was looking to get out of the police force. I see people making the same mistakes time and time again when they are trying to get a job in IT: Sending resumes out and hoping for the bestWaiting for jobs to appear online before applyingSending generic resumes which will never be readFailing to prepare properly for technical interviewsNot presenting themselves professionally to companiesand many more common mistakes Break Into IT has been devised with people like you in mind. It is a one stop training resource to help you plan, prepare and execute your plan to get you from where you are now to where you want to be. Here are just a few of the things you will learn: How to find the best jobs before they appear onlineHow to tap into vast networks of people willing to help youThe secrets to getting your resume readHow to get called for interviewsHow to ace technical interviewsStanding out from the crowdHow to bridge the lack of experience problemHow to negotiate your salary and benefitsHow to get advancement once you get inand much more These tips will help you if you want to apply for any IT roles including: Networking\nDesktop support\nHelpdesk\nProgramming\nWeb design\nProject management and support Most people are doing it all wrong and never get called for interviews. They wonder why but because they don't know how the system works they will be forever in the dark. These principles have been used my thousands of my students to break into IT.

His presentations flowed with a mix of humor, science and concrete examples which kept me engaged and eager for the next nugget of wisdom. Among the many nuggets, Tom demonstrated how we can all access our genius and bring choice to our lives. Tom’s passion and ability to show how science can work for you in daily life is inspiring, energizing and uplifting. I highly recommend Tom for career advice or transition.” January 18, 2012 Top qualities: Great Results, High Integrity, Creative Eileen Wallace, ACSR hired Tom as a Career Coach in 2012 ____________________________________________ “Angela provided me with career transition consulting and my only regret was not finding her sooner! From the help re-writing my resume, to the worksheets that helped me to understand my key competencies (very useful for competency-based interviews), to understanding the importance of networking and LinkedIn. Every piece of information and advice Angela gave me was incredibly helpful and definitely got me out of my job search rut. In addition, her upbeat and positive attitude made it an all around pleasant experience working with her. Angela is the ultimate expert at what she does.” June 11, 2011 Top qualities: Great Results, Expert, High Integrity Jamelyn Hart hired Angela as a Career Coach in 2011","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19331_7e81_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/13x4xthe-science-of-career-transition/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development"],"rating":3.4,"reviews":19,"isFree":false,"matches":["37747181-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736011-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720085-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"career-mind-mastery-learn-how-to-get-your-dream-job"},{"id":"37713d38-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"18016","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.690Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Prepare For the Future - Get the Best Education You Can!","headline":"With the future uncertain, prepare now by getting the best education you can get.","description":" Over 5 hours of lecture!!!

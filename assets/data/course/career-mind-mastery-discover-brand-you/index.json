Nearly a decade of experience in 2 hours. Enroll now.","description":"This Udemy course has been taken over by over 2,000 students around the world. LATEST: Course Updated Again for September 2015Learn EXACTLY what I've taught international brands like McDonald's and evian... in only 2 hours!Gain the skills major brands have paid hundreds of thousands for. Quickly and easily.Over 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.Have you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"I've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.It has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.I make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.When I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.I know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.Every single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.Nothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics. And you pay NOTHING EXTRA for this ongoing content.Plus, Udemy has a 30 day guarantee. And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.What this is course IS NOT:I do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.I will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.I won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.But, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.Every minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...Enroll now!","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25581_4b8c_14.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/branding-public-relations-social-media-cc/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Business Branding"],"rating":3.5,"reviews":34,"isFree":false,"matches":["3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377052d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"how-to-master-branding-public-relations-and-social-media"},{"id":"3774bfa7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"24383","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.885Z","updated":"2013-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Archetypal Branding: The Secrets of building a Premium Brand","headline":"How the World's Best Brands build Brand Identity that turns Consumers into Brand Lovers that are Loyal for Life","description":"\"Archetypal Branding: The Secrets of Building a Premium Brand\" is designed to provide you with a systematic way to: • Clearly define the Brand so that it is compelling and credible to your key Target Audiences. • Create a Brand Identity that all key internal Constituencies can agree on and work from. • Increase the Reputation, Image, perceived Value and Brand Awareness of your Company Take this Branding Your Business Course and learn how to build a Brand for your Business that commands Premium Prices and turns Customers into Brand Advocates that are Loyal for Life. </p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/24383_9ccf_10.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/archetypal-branding/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Branding","Business Branding"],"rating":3.9,"reviews":294,"isFree":true,"matches":["376ea525-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733909-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711624-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d11a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789031-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37724ea3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"archetypal-branding-the-secrets-of-building-a-premium-brand"},{"id":"37736011-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"22046","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.813Z","updated":"2013-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Career Mind Mastery: Bring Who You Are to What You Do","headline":"Your Talents + This System = Total Awesomeness.","description":"Your Talents + This System = Total Awesomeness.

His presentations flowed with a mix of humor, science and concrete examples which kept me engaged and eager for the next nugget of wisdom. Among the many nuggets, Tom demonstrated how we can all access our genius and bring choice to our lives. Tom’s passion and ability to show how science can work for you in daily life is inspiring, energizing and uplifting. I highly recommend Tom for career advice or transition.” January 18, 2012 Top qualities: Great Results, High Integrity, Creative Eileen Wallace, ACSR hired Tom as a Career Coach in 2012 ____________________________________________ “Angela provided me with career transition consulting and my only regret was not finding her sooner! From the help re-writing my resume, to the worksheets that helped me to understand my key competencies (very useful for competency-based interviews), to understanding the importance of networking and LinkedIn. Every piece of information and advice Angela gave me was incredibly helpful and definitely got me out of my job search rut. In addition, her upbeat and positive attitude made it an all around pleasant experience working with her. Angela is the ultimate expert at what she does.” June 11, 2011 Top qualities: Great Results, Expert, High Integrity Jamelyn Hart hired Angela as a Career Coach in 2011","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19331_7e81_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/13x4xthe-science-of-career-transition/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development"],"rating":3.4,"reviews":19,"isFree":false,"matches":["37747181-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736011-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d544-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfaa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720085-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775aa04-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"career-mind-mastery-learn-how-to-get-your-dream-job"},{"id":"3770ef14-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"17708","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.603Z","updated":"2014-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Everyday Mind Mastery","headline":"Learn the easiest way to master your mind and control your life with Ben Franklin's 13x4 and some neat algorithms.","description":" Welcome to Everyday Mind Mastery, the leading personal development course on Udemy. Over 75,000 students CURRENTLY enrolled! So, you might ask - what's the fuss all about? Well, there are two reasons people seem to like it: 1. Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) 2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively. You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. Why? How? Really? Yes, and it's all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) So, do you ever ask yourself, \"I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?\" Let's face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You've got a copy of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' on your bookshelf, you know it's a great book yet you haven't opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you've not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you're still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It's pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don't have an iron will. I don't even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I'm honest. Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn't really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just 'have more self-discipline', just 'get better'. That's why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn't even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. So, you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So, instead of increasing our willpower, let's use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We're still going to have to do the work, it's just that we won't have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I'm not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We're afraid that we won't stick at things because that's what we've done in the past. We're afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we'd rather not try. We're afraid we're not good enough. We're afraid we don't have enough willpower. We're not afraid of doing the work, we're afraid that our work won't work! So, the big question is what's going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you're ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... ________________ Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and 'Thought Engineer', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. The system takes 'One thing at a time' to a new level: it's monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you've ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! It's basically the shizzle is what I'm saying...

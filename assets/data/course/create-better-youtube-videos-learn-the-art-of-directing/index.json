WIN 'EM OVER WITH WEB VIDEO PART 2: Stand Out and Move Up in Search Engine Results with Effective Web Video (HOW TO PREVENT A RAIN OUT ON YOUR FIELD OF DREAMS WITH WEB VIDEO):  This is a beginner-friendly course for busy professionals who want to learn how to create effective web video AND boost their search engine optimization efforts. Students will learn the basics of web video production and search engine optimization. This course provides video, screen records, and sample files for busy professionals who want the most essential information presented to them in a manner that can be quickly and easily digested and applied in under a half day (4 hours).

She has produced numerous documentary-style web videos for small business owners and non-profit organizations since 2002. Ms. Appel worked in Hollywood in licensing at Universal Studios and Business Affairs at International Creative Management (ICM) and in programming at the Sundance Film Festival. She is a graduate of Yale University and where earned a BA in American Studies with a concentration in Film Studies and USC's School of Cinema-Television, now Cinematic Arts, where she earned her Master's degree.  She is also a certified SEO Practitioner. \"What I love most about producing videos for small business owners and nonprofits is the opportunity to work with passionate professionals who are experts in their field. I feel very fortunate to be able to use my skills as a visual storyteller to help others. Unfortunately, I am not able to help every worthy business owner out there because not everyone can afford to hire a professional like myself to produce a video for them.  That is why I decided to develop a course that could empower more businesses, start ups, and nonprofits compete and share their passion with the world.\" Ms. Appel has been a faculty member at a number of accredited offline colleges throughout the State of California.  As an experienced film and multimedia instructor, she takes into consideration the three main learning styles: aural (listening- you can listen to the modules), visual (you can watch the videos with images that will hopefully stay with you), and kinetic (movement- you can exercise your kinetic learning style by taking notes and doing the quizzes). In addition to the modules or short training videos, there are samples and screen recordings * (Including FinalCut Pro and After FX demos) for all three stages: pre-production or planning, production or shooting, and post-production or editing; so that you can follow along throughout the process. To further your learning experience, there is an interactive coaching program that complements the e-learning course and supplementary materials. During the coaching calls we will delve more deeply into the materials with scenarios and go over the quizzes. Questions can be answered live and students can participate in interviews with other industry experts. As someone who has purchased this Web Video Production course, you get your first month's membership for free.

This course teaches you how processors work and how machine code is possible. We start the course using an emulator for the legacy Intel 8086 processor.Since we start the course with an emulator it allows me to pause the machine at any moment in time and show you exactly what is going on.After you learn all about the legacy 8086 processor and how to program assembly for it we then move to the modern processors of today and start writing assembly for those. You are taught how to write 32 bit programs for Windows machine's and most importantly how to communicate with C programs using assembly language.This course recommends that you have some prior experience in the C programming language or at the very least some programming experience in another language. The reason for this is because part two of the course when I teach modern assembly I reference the C programming language quite a lot since we write assembly that can talk with C.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2749466_d775_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Software Engineering","Assembly Language"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742364-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d39-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"x86-assembly-language-programming-masters-course"},{"id":"3776bb76-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27970","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2018-08-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"CCNA Security 2019 210-260 Video Boot Camp With Chris Bryant","headline":"Earn Your CCNA Security 210-260 Certification AND Prepare For Real-World Networking Success!","description":"Over 150,000 students in my Video Boot Camps have joined my Video Boot Camps on Udemy, and now it's your turn!Every single video in this CCNA Security 210-260 Video Boot Camp is downloadable, and you'll get your certification with the clearest, most comprehensive CCNA Security course available  - and without busting your budget!  Even better, your access to the CCNA Security training course is permanent, and every video is downloadable for viewing offline!Thanks for making my course part of your CCNA Security certification success story!  Chris Bryant CCIE #12933 \"The Computer Certification Bulldog\"    ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/27970_dbe6_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/ccnasecurityvideobootcamp/","language":"en","tags":["IT & Software","IT Certification","Cisco CCNA"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":3107,"isFree":false,"matches":["376cd065-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376be601-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376be600-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b49c1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376b49c0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779a1a0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c0b-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37713d3c-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789037-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777f3f0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"ccna-security-2019-210-260-video-boot-camp-with-chris-bryant"},{"id":"37720083-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19450","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.696Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"IP Subnetting Masterclass - Learn the Easy Way to Subnet","headline":"Learn subnetting in 15 seconds flat with my subnetting cheat sheet in this subnetting tutorial.","description":"Most IT Engineers Can’t Subnet…here’s why…Understanding IP Subnetting is a vital skill for every IT\nengineer and yet most don’t know how to do it or go about it completely the\nwrong way.

Taught by Tony Hillerson. Learn how to use Git practically.","description":"Have you heard of Git? Have you been wondering what all the buzz is about? Have you heard about all the open source software projects moving to Github? Have you been thinking that it's time to give Git a try yourself? We think it is too, and we think this course will help. This course is a different approach to learning Git than, say, reading online documentation or buying a book on Git because you'll see not only how Git works, but how you should work with Git. We'll show you the situations that you probably find yourself in as a developer all the time and how Git can help you work faster, work with more confidence, and save yourself and your teammates time by supporting a good workflow. We'll show you how Git works in practice, and also how to practice Git. Session One: Git and You In this first session we'll cover getting started with Git and daily workflow which will become second nature to you. We'll get it in your fingers. Not only that, but all the operations we'll use Git for will be completely local to our own systems. One of the things that first piques people's interest in Git is that it's distributed. They wonder what that means and how it affects them. In later sessions we'll understand the answers to questions about the distributed nature of Git, but one side effect of it is that many of Git's operations are completely local to your own computer. A Git repository can live out a useful and completely local life all on one computer, and we'll see that side of working with Git. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: What does Git do? Who came up with Git, and who works on it? How Git keeps a history of your project over time How Git stores your files What are all those really long strings of letters and numbers? How a Git repository is structured What is Git's index for? The components of Git: trees, refs, and blobs Practice: Working with files in Git The standard workflow when committing changes to the repository Commits in Git Working with git log Querying the Git repository How to get help on Git Session Two: Git and Your Team Git has no particular need to work with any repository than the local one on your computer, unlike many other version control systems but that wouldn't be very fun would it? Git really becomes useful when you and your team members use it to facilitate collaborating on a project. We'll start to understand what it means that Git is distributed. One of the first things people wonder when they hear that Git is distributed, or that Git doesn't need a central server, is \"Can I still have a central server for my team?\". Of course you can, and many teams still work the same way they have with other versioning systems. We'll see how to do that as well as share changes with another computer directly. We'll set up an account on Github and use that to learn how to deal with remote repositories. We'll also learn about very important concept in version control systems: branching. Git makes branching so easy that it's time to learn how you should be integrating branching into your workflow. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: What are remotes? What are some strategies for collaboration with Git? How does Git transfer changes? How does pulling changes work? How does branching work in Git? What does rebase do? What is the Git stash? How does tagging work in Git? Practice: Cloning a repository Pushing, pulling, and fetching changes Creating branches Pushing and pulling from branches Setting up a tracking branch Merging and dealing with conflicts How and when to rebase Seeing who did what with git blame Session Three: Git in the Real World Session three is all about the how Git works and how you work with Git out there in the wild. Chances are you first heard about Git and Github almost in the same sentence. In fact sometimes it's easy to forget that Github is just a logical extension to Git itself. Github is a wildly popular way to host and collaborate on Open Source software projects using Git. Some of the most important software tools you may use every day are now hosted or mirrored on Github, such as Rails, jQuery, or Postgres. Github's unique philosophy on forking, or branching off developement on a software project, makes it easy for anyone to contribute to their favorite open source tools. We'll dig deeper into how to work with Github. Next we'll go over a whole list of interesting tools Git gives you work a lot faster. Interactive adding, adding using patch mode, interactive merging, and some advanced logging and querying techniques for finding exactly what's been going on in your repository. We'll also cover a very important topic in software development: \"screwing things up\". Not only do we often really mess up the project we're working on, we can also make mistakes in Git itself. Luckily Git is there to help with both of those kinds of problems. Git provides ways to not only commit changes, which is helpful in itself to any software project, but also to fix, reorder, play back, cherry pick, and recover lost commits. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: How can I get exactly what I want out of the log? How can I find exactly what I want in the repo? What is the reflog and what does it do? Does the repository require any maintenance? How does forking work on Github? How can I stay up to date with the original repository? How do I submit my commits back to the original repository? Practice: git add -i git rebase -i git commit --amend git reset, hard and soft git revert git cherry-pick git gc git reflog Forking a repository on Github Submitting a pull request on Github ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8319_ec03_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/git-in-theory-and-in-practice/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Development Tools","Git"],"rating":3.8,"reviews":12,"isFree":false,"matches":["3778b744-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377582f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730aa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716446-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef14-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"git-basics-in-theory-and-practice"},"related":[{"id":"377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2742924","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.097Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Effective Learning - Learn to Learn","headline":"Learn how to learn effectively","description":"In this course you will learn the truth about effective learning.

Students will emerge at the end with a very solid understanding and hands-on experience with Git and GitHub.Course OrganizationThe course is divided into four major components:Introduction and SetupLearning Git Source ControlAll About GitHubEach one of the above components spans multiple sections in this course.IntroductionThe Introduction provides a welcome to the course including some useful tips for getting the most out of taking the course and how the course is designed. That is followed by the Core Concepts which go over some critical theory before diving straight into Git.After the introduction and core concepts, the first thing we do is a Quick Installation for both Windows and Mac. The Bonus section has a more comprehensive, step-by-step process for those that prefer it.Learning Git Source ControlIn The Basics, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.With a strong foundation in place, we explore some more Advanced Git topics like comparing differences, branching and merge resolution, tagging special events, saving work in progress, and even a bit of time travel.All About GitHubThe main part of this course is all about GitHub. We will explore GitHub indepth from a source control hosting repository perspective.In Welcome to GitHub we start off exploring some of the basic features of GitHub by creating a fresh repository and associate our local repository with it. Then, we prepare for the remainder of the course by setting up SSH Authentication, which we will use from this point forward. After that, we continue looking at the GitHub Repository, including many of the same operations we performed locally, but done directly within GitHub. Then in GitHub Repository Branches we dive into how Branches on GitHub and our local system work with each other.After we have comprehensively covered how GitHub repositories work, we focus on how GitHub Tags and Releases work and their relationship with local tags in Git. We can then use tags/releases while Comparing Differences on GitHub.We start tying things together in Social Coding where we join other projects on GitHub by forking and then submitting our contributions back using pull requests.Once part of a team, you might use GitHub Issues to track defects or enhancement requests.Sometimes you just need to share small parts of a file or a set of files, but don't want to bother with a full Git repository. That where GitHub Gists help out -- share just a snip of code or entire files.Finally, group related GitHub repositories with GitHub Organizations and manage permissions and access using teams.Course FeaturesAll tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind.Presentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is nearly 5 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.All videos are available in high quality 1080p / Full HD resolution for sharp and clear viewing on modern desktops and tablets.Several attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.Moving ForwardThis course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials and bonus content!

Over 75,000 students CURRENTLY enrolled! So, you might ask - what's the fuss all about? Well, there are two reasons people seem to like it: 1. Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) 2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively. You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. Why? How? Really? Yes, and it's all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) So, do you ever ask yourself, \"I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?\" Let's face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You've got a copy of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' on your bookshelf, you know it's a great book yet you haven't opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you've not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you're still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It's pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don't have an iron will. I don't even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I'm honest. Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn't really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just 'have more self-discipline', just 'get better'. That's why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn't even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. So, you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So, instead of increasing our willpower, let's use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We're still going to have to do the work, it's just that we won't have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I'm not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We're afraid that we won't stick at things because that's what we've done in the past. We're afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we'd rather not try. We're afraid we're not good enough. We're afraid we don't have enough willpower. We're not afraid of doing the work, we're afraid that our work won't work! So, the big question is what's going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you're ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... ________________ Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and 'Thought Engineer', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. The system takes 'One thing at a time' to a new level: it's monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you've ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! It's basically the shizzle is what I'm saying...

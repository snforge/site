Designed for entrepreneurs, businesses, and junior developers.","description":"Are you a creative or entrepreneur that wishes you could speak tech with your web development team? Maybe you wish you could code a bit yourself?  Programming for Non-Programmers is online course designed to help non-programmers communicate more efficiently with developers.  Because leading a development team (without being a developer yourself) can sometimes feels like “talking about dancing”, I've created an interactive and easy to follow environment in which to learn the basics.  And for developers just getting started, think of this as the primer to help kickstart your career.  If you're running a tech start-up, it's essential that you familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of web development. Ultimately knowing how to \"talk to the talk\" will help you communicate better with developers, and overall just look really cool.  What You'll Learn   In this course we'll tackle some development principles to get you on the right path. We'll look at questions like, \"Front-end vs. Back-end?\", \"Is UX necessary for my project?\", \"What is this Javascript function thingy, and why am I passing it strange math equations to it?\".  What coding languages should I use for my next project?Which CMS is right for the job?What are the stages of web development?What deliverables do I need to provide my developer? (FYI - This is important and often neglected or done poorly)Reading code & basic developing principles to get us startedKey concepts of programming that are the found in every programming languageUnderstanding Javascript Variables & LogicLooking for corporate training?  I'm based in New York City, and available to bring my workshop Programming for Non-Programmers to your company. Past clients include: American Express, GE, NASDAQ, Razorfish, and more! Email me chris[at]onemonth .com for details.  Live Support! (I'm Here To Answer Your Questions)  I'm available for questions to all students taking the class. By joining the class you gain access to message me through email.

So far you're the only one who has been able to teach me how to code.\" - Darren Hakimi, Analyst  \"You are articulate and engaging. Broad and diverse range of topics. Not easy to address so much in limited time.\" - student feedback  Even for a non tech person like me (who yes, has 50,000 emails in her inbox and actually thinks thats totally normal), I was able to keep up. My intent was to get a good overview of what the heck programming actually is, and better understand the language/terms associated with it.  I  certainly got that.  I also appreciated your passion for teaching.

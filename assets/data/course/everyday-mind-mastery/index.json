Over 75,000 students CURRENTLY enrolled! So, you might ask - what's the fuss all about? Well, there are two reasons people seem to like it: 1. Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) 2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively. You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. Why? How? Really? Yes, and it's all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) So, do you ever ask yourself, \"I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?\" Let's face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. You join the gym in January but by the end of February... The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... You've got a copy of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' on your bookshelf, you know it's a great book yet you haven't opened it since 1995... You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you've not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you're still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It's pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don't have an iron will. I don't even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I'm honest. Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn't really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. The standard approach is basically just 'have more self-discipline', just 'get better'. That's why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn't even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. So, you have two options: 1. Change 2. Be yourself + Use a System Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. So, instead of increasing our willpower, let's use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We're still going to have to do the work, it's just that we won't have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. I'm not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We're afraid that we won't stick at things because that's what we've done in the past. We're afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we'd rather not try. We're afraid we're not good enough. We're afraid we don't have enough willpower. We're not afraid of doing the work, we're afraid that our work won't work! So, the big question is what's going to be easier for you? Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you're ever going to get what you want out of life? Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... ________________ Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and 'Thought Engineer', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. The system takes 'One thing at a time' to a new level: it's monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you've ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! It's basically the shizzle is what I'm saying...

Are you unemployed? Are you in a state of transition and want to identify what’s next? Do you believe that you were born to do something extraordinary, but just can’t figure out what it is? Well, I have some really good news for you – The Reinvention Workshop will forever change your life. And, because you’ve made a conscious choice to visit this course, you’ve already taken your first powerful step towards reinventing yourself and becoming who you were born to be. The Reinvention Workshop will teach YOU my proven formula for discovering your WHAT — that is, the ONE thing you were born to do — and create a powerful plan of action for getting paid extraordinarily well sharing your unique gift with the world. Learn how to REINVENT yourself. Led by me, Steve Olsher, author of the award-winning books, Internet Prophets: The World’s Leading Experts Reveal How to Profit Onlineand Journey To You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming Who You Were Born to Be; co-star of the groundbreaking film, The Keeper of the Keys, alongside Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Marci Shimoff; founder and host of Reinvention Radio; and an in-demand media guest who has appeared on ABC TV, Fox TV, the WB, CNBC.com, and more than 200 radio shows including nationally syndicated programs hosted by Lou Dobbs, Mancow Muller, and Jim Bohannon, The Reinvention Workshop puts fire in your soul! How do you pursue what you love AND make money doing it? Most people don’t create their ideal life because they can’t identify what they want to do and don’t feel it’s possible to make it happen. You will find the answers you need at The Reinvention Workshop and gain a clear understanding of your life’s purpose and be fired up about, and highly focused on, achieving it. I’m a steadfast believer that we should learn from the trials and tribulations of those selfless enough to teach. I’ve been fortunate to benefit from the guidance of incredible mentors — I hope you’ll allow me to mentor you. Over the past 20 years, I’ve developed and refined the proprietary exercises, theories, and principles you’ll find at The Reinvention Workshop. Each is crafted from my own often painful, hands-on experience. I’ve made the mistakes and suffered the inevitable results. You don’t have to. My unique methodology blends ancient wisdom from a multitude of spiritual leaders, including Buddha, with revolutionary lessons from modern theorists, such as Dr. Thomas Gordon, creator of The Four Stages of Learning. These teachings, combined with my unique exercises and singular approach to realizing permanent, positive change, form a proven system for ultimate achievement in business and life. The tools I provide at The Reinvention Workshop will show you powerful shortcuts you can immediately implement to create the life you deserve and desire while avoiding the pitfalls of going it alone and transform your life starting right now. Everyone has natural-born greatness. Do you know what yours is? Horace Mann said, “A person should be ashamed to die, until (s)he has made a monumental impact on mankind.” How are you going to leave your mark? What will your legacy be? Becoming who you were meant to be begins with taking the first step. I strongly believe the destination IS the road and that the JOURNEY is the destination. The Reinvention Workshop is a quest for the most precious of destinations: your true self. Let me guide you through it. I look forward to helping you reinvent your life and having a powerful impact on our world. The world is waiting for you!</p> ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/25557_5692_5.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-reinvention-workshop-discover-what-you-were-born-to-do/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Career Development","Personal Development"],"rating":4.2,"reviews":66,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769466-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720081-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d116-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377079e3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b30-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"discover-the-1-thing-you-were-born-to-do-in-5-easy-steps"},{"id":"3773ae38-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"22990","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.815Z","updated":"2014-09-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Access Your Genius with Richard Wilkins","headline":"Learn how to easily access your Inner Greatness and how to become a genius.","description":" Over 5,600 students currently enrolled. Course updated September 10 2014. WARNING - This course POLARIZES people: You'll either LOVE it or HATE it as the reviews will show you! 5-Star: 'Insightful, Helpful, Practical, Optimistic and Holistic' As for the words I used above, I like the fact that it is easy to understand yet maintains great depth. If you are someone who is suffering from depression or anxiety - whatever it may be, you will likely find this incredibly helpful. If you feel your fine, you'll still find this interesting and hopefully worthwhile. Better yet, not only for you, but for others you may know. All in all, I find the message here, uniquely, and heavily related to the messages to many of the figures I admire. There is much that can be said, but it is for you to experience and come up with a conclusion. I'm sure it will be worth your while. Honestly, I found this message to be a fantastic and important gift. I'm glad it's here free. - Brian 5-Star: Great program to make you think Its a great program that makes you think and see what it is that is really holding you back. No the question is what are you going to do about it after you've completed the course. - Mirko 1-Star: rubbish this guy sounds like a total looney freak with an IQ level of a biscuite... you sure you should be teaching about genius? couldnt handle listening to more than half of the first lecture. - Pouya Interesting huh? So what's in the course? And why does it divide opinion so much? Tom Cassidy asks Richard Wilkins, the founder of the UK's Ministry of Inspiration , to sum up his thoughts on 'Being a Genius v. Accessing Genius'. Richard explains his system that allows ordinary people to access the genius that is available to us all. It explains what it really means to 'be' a genius, and why most people who are thought of as geniuses end up being somewhat disappointing as we find out more about them. It also enables us to deal with all the 'yeah but...' beliefs that our own internal programmings throw up at us, and it allows us to be comfortable doing great things, without having to then live with the epithet 'genius'. In our experience of delivering this message to people, we've found that a lot of people won't like the simplicity of the message, they won't dare to believe that they have the power to access genius themselves and they will resent the ease with which its methods appear to work. You see, if it really IS this simple then it takes away people's excuses for not doing it. And people might not like that very much. Anyway, Take this free “Access Your Genius” course, see what all the fuss is about and learn how to become a genius yourself. the world is waiting...

Taught by Tony Hillerson. Learn how to use Git practically.","description":"Have you heard of Git? Have you been wondering what all the buzz is about? Have you heard about all the open source software projects moving to Github? Have you been thinking that it's time to give Git a try yourself? We think it is too, and we think this course will help. This course is a different approach to learning Git than, say, reading online documentation or buying a book on Git because you'll see not only how Git works, but how you should work with Git. We'll show you the situations that you probably find yourself in as a developer all the time and how Git can help you work faster, work with more confidence, and save yourself and your teammates time by supporting a good workflow. We'll show you how Git works in practice, and also how to practice Git. Session One: Git and You In this first session we'll cover getting started with Git and daily workflow which will become second nature to you. We'll get it in your fingers. Not only that, but all the operations we'll use Git for will be completely local to our own systems. One of the things that first piques people's interest in Git is that it's distributed. They wonder what that means and how it affects them. In later sessions we'll understand the answers to questions about the distributed nature of Git, but one side effect of it is that many of Git's operations are completely local to your own computer. A Git repository can live out a useful and completely local life all on one computer, and we'll see that side of working with Git. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: What does Git do? Who came up with Git, and who works on it? How Git keeps a history of your project over time How Git stores your files What are all those really long strings of letters and numbers? How a Git repository is structured What is Git's index for? The components of Git: trees, refs, and blobs Practice: Working with files in Git The standard workflow when committing changes to the repository Commits in Git Working with git log Querying the Git repository How to get help on Git Session Two: Git and Your Team Git has no particular need to work with any repository than the local one on your computer, unlike many other version control systems but that wouldn't be very fun would it? Git really becomes useful when you and your team members use it to facilitate collaborating on a project. We'll start to understand what it means that Git is distributed. One of the first things people wonder when they hear that Git is distributed, or that Git doesn't need a central server, is \"Can I still have a central server for my team?\". Of course you can, and many teams still work the same way they have with other versioning systems. We'll see how to do that as well as share changes with another computer directly. We'll set up an account on Github and use that to learn how to deal with remote repositories. We'll also learn about very important concept in version control systems: branching. Git makes branching so easy that it's time to learn how you should be integrating branching into your workflow. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: What are remotes? What are some strategies for collaboration with Git? How does Git transfer changes? How does pulling changes work? How does branching work in Git? What does rebase do? What is the Git stash? How does tagging work in Git? Practice: Cloning a repository Pushing, pulling, and fetching changes Creating branches Pushing and pulling from branches Setting up a tracking branch Merging and dealing with conflicts How and when to rebase Seeing who did what with git blame Session Three: Git in the Real World Session three is all about the how Git works and how you work with Git out there in the wild. Chances are you first heard about Git and Github almost in the same sentence. In fact sometimes it's easy to forget that Github is just a logical extension to Git itself. Github is a wildly popular way to host and collaborate on Open Source software projects using Git. Some of the most important software tools you may use every day are now hosted or mirrored on Github, such as Rails, jQuery, or Postgres. Github's unique philosophy on forking, or branching off developement on a software project, makes it easy for anyone to contribute to their favorite open source tools. We'll dig deeper into how to work with Github. Next we'll go over a whole list of interesting tools Git gives you work a lot faster. Interactive adding, adding using patch mode, interactive merging, and some advanced logging and querying techniques for finding exactly what's been going on in your repository. We'll also cover a very important topic in software development: \"screwing things up\". Not only do we often really mess up the project we're working on, we can also make mistakes in Git itself. Luckily Git is there to help with both of those kinds of problems. Git provides ways to not only commit changes, which is helpful in itself to any software project, but also to fix, reorder, play back, cherry pick, and recover lost commits. When this session is complete you'll understand: Theory: How can I get exactly what I want out of the log? How can I find exactly what I want in the repo? What is the reflog and what does it do? Does the repository require any maintenance? How does forking work on Github? How can I stay up to date with the original repository? How do I submit my commits back to the original repository? Practice: git add -i git rebase -i git commit --amend git reset, hard and soft git revert git cherry-pick git gc git reflog Forking a repository on Github Submitting a pull request on Github ","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8319_ec03_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/git-in-theory-and-in-practice/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Development Tools","Git"],"rating":3.8,"reviews":12,"isFree":false,"matches":["3778b744-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377582f9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769465-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730aa-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716446-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef14-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376d93b0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716445-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cd064-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"git-basics-in-theory-and-practice"}]}}

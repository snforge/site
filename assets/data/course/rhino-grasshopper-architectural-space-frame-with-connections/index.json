This class is intended for students who have already learned some basic pattern making skills are seeking alternative methods to create more advanced patterns. The starting point is a hand inked pattern, so drawing and inking is essential and the hope is you have something in-hand to practice with. Having basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is an asset and I will try to clearly explain all the steps as we proceed. The process can be intimidating at first, but using these techniques make it much easier.This course will arm you with all the knowledge necessary. This alternative pattern-making skillset is an ideal competence if you are fabric designer, illustrator or surface pattern designer, or simply a graphic designer on a mission to create a self-sustaining career. Many insights about designing will be shared and hopefully they can inspire you to take a look at your current pattern designs and have you planning many different projects in the future.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2746622_f3d3_2.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/blending-traditional-with-digital-techniques-in-pattern-making/","language":"en","tags":["Design","Graphic Design","Surface Pattern Design"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["3773872a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b54-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f822-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3779efc3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b59-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733907-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"blending-traditional-and-digital-techniques-in-pattern-making"},{"id":"37777ec3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750054","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.041Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"AWS認定 Solutions Architect Associate試験問題(2020)","headline":"AWS認定 SAA試験問題に絶対合格","description":"この３回分、１９５問題を繰り返し練習し、合格できる本番レベルそのままを再現、特に３番目模擬テストは本番でよく出る問題です。本番試験前１日絶対繰り返し練習しよう。問題の解説と各選択肢の理解を詳しく説明し、AWS知識として習得可能","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2750054_50b6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-associate2020/","language":"ja","tags":["IT & Software","IT Certification"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37792c7b-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377ab311-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e5708-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778de55-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37795380-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773d546-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ecc33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376bbef2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37797a93-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a8c00-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"aws-solutions-architect-associate-2020"},{"id":"3776e288-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"28636","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.945Z","updated":"2015-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Art History Renaissance to 20th Century","headline":"A basic level survey of painting, sculpture, and architecture.","description":"This is part one of a year-long college-level survey course in art history.

Why don’t figure drawing books tellyou how important it is to master the stick figure before you even startdrawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher.

I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69dollars. What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me. But why? Why would I do that? Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, nooffice rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instantstreaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them.  “I had spent a lot ofmoney previously on books and classes however what i have learned from bothyour Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and ireally enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance ofpractice, practice, practice.

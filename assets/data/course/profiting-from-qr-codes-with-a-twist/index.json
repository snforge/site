If your business is not using the QR Codes\ntechnology, you run the risk of not just losing your current customers\nto businesses who have already implemented the software, but you run\nthe risk of losing any potential customers in your particular field.\n \nExample of How QR Codes Are Used:\n \nThere\nare many reasons why a local brick and mortar store front need to\nimplement mobile marketing and QR Codes into their advertising\ncampaigns. Many brick and mortar shoppers today remain women, and as\nthey account for the majority of mobile technology purchased in the\npast three years, it would make sense to target a campaign around them.\n \nOne reason to use the QR Codes technology in the apparel\nindustry is because you give the customer the ability to access your\ngoods more easily than ever before. Customers can simply run the\nbarcode by their smartphone and within seconds find out every detail,\nfrom price to availability, all in the palm of their hands.\n \nThis saves them time trying to get their questions answered.\n \nQR Codes Bridge the Online and Offline Worlds\n \nWith\nthe buzz that QR Codes have been creating lately, it is becoming clear\nthat they offer a unique way to connect mobile consumers with online\ndigital content, quickly and easily. \n","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/26656_e6e7_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/profiting-from-qr-codes/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Mobile Apps","QR Codes"],"rating":3.7,"reviews":4,"isFree":false,"matches":["37736018-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d11a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef17-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"profiting-from-qr-codes-with-a-twist"},"related":[{"id":"377a64f6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2743562","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.150Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Generate thousands of high-qualified leads with Instagram","headline":"How to 10X your business in the next 6 months","description":"The IG Business University is a brand new online program that I created because I want to share with you EVERYTHING I learned about getting high-quality leads and turning them into paying customers in the past 6 years of being an entrepreneur.In it you´ll learn how you can use Instagram to generate thousands of high quality leads for FREE for your business and turn them into paying customers.With the strategies and the step-by-step blueprint that you´ll get inside the IG Business University, you´ll be able to 10X your business in the next 6 months using Instagram.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2743562_18cb.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/generate-thousands-of-high-qualified-leads-with-instagram/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Sales","Lead Generation"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["376c0d11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a64f8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37789031-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf773-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770ef17-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"generate-thousands-of-high-qualified-leads-with-instagram"},{"id":"3777a5d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2750120","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.042Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Learn The Power of Social Media Stories for Marketing","headline":"Promote yourself using social media stories just like senior marketers do","description":"The organic reach of business accounts on a number of social platforms is decreasing.Stories provide a great ROI in terms of the time and effort they require and the benefits they offer.Stories are also extremely popular with customers and users right now.Four out of five major brands report using stories to promote themselves, and that should tell you something about how big this is going to be going forward.With this video course you will:learn precisely what a story islearn how to create a storylearn how to have huge success using stories to grow your audiencelearn how to increase brand loyaltyhow to promote yourself using stories just like major brands do","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2750120_4deb.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-power-of-social-media-stories-for-marketers-n/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Social Media Marketing"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb70-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775f824-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3da-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776946a-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learn-the-power-of-social-media-stories-for-marketing"},{"id":"3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"27625","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.944Z","updated":"2015-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Web CopyWriting: Consistently Outperform Your Competitors","headline":"Discover the key strategies behind winning content for websites, blogs, social media and email marketing.","description":"Learn How the Web affects how people read online and what can you do to make your writing more effective.

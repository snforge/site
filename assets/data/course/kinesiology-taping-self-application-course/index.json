Its originator, Dr. Roger Callahan, first formulated his school of energy psychology in the late 1970s. His schema consists of tapping on the acupoints of the body in particular sequences that he feels is necessary to relieve depression, anxiety, addictions, and other mental health problems.  He has validated his technique through many research studies where TFT was shown to perform much better than many other psychological techniques such as cognitive therapy. This course investigates Thought Field Therapy in lecture form and video demonstrations. It is suitable for both the lay person and clinicians. Developed by Gary Craig, Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT is the best known and most popular school of energy psychology. EFT is essentially an offshoot of Thought Field Therapy (TFT). EFT is a simple, quick and painless technique that can be used without a therapist's assistance, making EFT the perfect self-help technique. This course describes EFT in detail in both lecture form and video demonstrations.</p></p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/27244_ca31_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-emotional-freedom-technique-and-thought-field-therapy/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Mental Health","EFT"],"rating":4.4,"reviews":14,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b97e0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770997-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742367-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea524-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377004b3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771b260-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37761f33-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377a3de4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learn-emotional-freedom-technique-and-thought-field-therapy"},{"id":"3772c3d4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"21256","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.812Z","updated":"2012-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Improve Your Physical and Mental Success with Tai Chi","headline":"Learn Tai Chi to improve your physical performance and balance your emotions.

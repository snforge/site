In order to do this you need to know the Excel Formulas, how to use charts in excel, setting up pivot tables, and of course Excel Macros (written using VBA). In this tutorial I use Excel 2010 to go over the formulas, charts, pivot tables, formula combinations, VBA code, and tips & tricks I used to master Excel and get better data and better results while not wasting any of my time manually doing stuff in Excel. I got in, I got it done fast, I got it done right, and I delivered results fast using these techniques. Think about how valuable that made me. The Excel Formulas I show you in this tutorial are the same ones I used to save my a** from getting fired from a job. I then used those same skills, as well as getting better with VBA to automate a business analyst job I had at a Fortune 500 company. The stuff in this Excel tutorial is powerful, it WILL make you valuable, but most importantly you’ll be able to SPEND LESS TIME IN EXCEL while delivering better data and better results.

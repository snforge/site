This is NOT an ESL course or a course teaching English. The students are assumed to have a basic command of the English grammar and the ability to read English instructions without any problems. If you have any questions or doubts about the content and nature of this course please inquire first before enrolling.HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: The course assumes you are using Microsoft Office installed on a Windows PC machine.  A majority of the instructions apply equally to both PC and Mac machines but for some lessons (like how to construct a Word template) you must use the Mac counterparts of the PC commands. ++++++++++ TECHNICAL WRITING PAYS WELLTechnical writers in the USA made an average of $71,950 a year, according to the latest available STC (Society for Technical Communication) Salary Data (2014). See Section 17 for 2014 selected salary highlights.According to glassdoor-dot-com, top-earning tech writers at companies like Google make as much as $165,000 a year.Obviously this course alone cannot guarantee that you will find a lucrative job right away but you will learn how to create your first technical document which you can use in applying for a technical writing position.+++++++++++ What Did They Say About This Course?\"It was a great help in learning about technical writing and editing techniques\"\"It was a great help in learning about technical writing and editing techniques, how to generate quality technical documentation. I liked the bonus section on Audience Analysis and RoboHelp. I'm hoping my certification will help me break into an entry level technical writer role.\"-- Olivia Amici\"It's an A+ course & instructor!\"\"This was a great course overall - especially for being free! It teaches the importance of understanding who your primary audience is & what kind of information to provide. To be honest, I also wanted to find out how the instructor is providing the information without paying before I purchase additional courses of his. He's a very great instructor that cares about his viewers! In my opinion, it's an A+ course & instructor!\"-- Chuck Larson\"This course is very helpful\"\"This course is very helpful especially for the beginners or for career changers who really want to establish a career in technical writing it briefs all contents required to be a technical writer.\"-- Upma\"I have already learned a great deal\"\"This course is a good match for me. I have already learned a great deal. I love writing, and have written procedures with screenshots in my previous job. I would love to get into Technical Writing!\"-- Regina Morgan\"I am absolutely amazed at how much information I have learned\"\"I am absolutely amazed at how much information I have learned. The purpose of taking this course is to apply for a Technical Writing job. The person that's referring me at her employer said to find a Level 2 course since I use business writing daily and I have self-published two mystery novels. I am so glad I did not listen to her advice and started a Level 1 course. I know I would not have been successful in the job if I did not have the knowledge I've learned here. Also, I used Microsoft Word everyday throughout my career so it was nice to learn the style and multi-level numbering features (I didn't expect this--a nice treat). Also, I was totally clueless about charts and graphs, X axis and Y axis, etc. This course offered way more than the $200 I paid. Thank you.\"-- Gwendolyn Pegram\" It's quite comforting to know that he is still very active regarding this course\"\"Most of what has been covered up to this point are things I know. I was already interested in making the career switch to Technical Writer, he just put extra emphasis on why it's a good decision. Edit: Just received a reply from Dr. Ugur Akinci about this review. It's quite comforting to know that he is still very active regarding this course. So be aware that if you partake in this course, you are not hung out to dry and don't have to flounder on your own.\"-- Kristen Ohlemeier\"A great way to break into the technical writing field\"\"The course is simple to understand and is a good way to brush up on what I learned from the university plus additional modern tools which I have not learned about in the past. Ugur is approachable and presents topics clearly. I also liked the exercises after the lectures. As a lifestyle writer/copywriter, I would say this is a great way to break into the technical writing field. I would say there are several things that I still need to learn, and this course is a fantastic starting point for me as it opened up a lot of ideas that I have to delve into.\"-- Robby Benson Torres\"Wonderful course. I learnt a lot!\"-- Hairul Hazri Suleiman\"A wonderful refresher...\"\"Many years ago, I worked as a technical writer, and this class has been a wonderful refresher for me. I think this would be a helpful class for someone who is entering the field of technical writing and needs to understand some of the field's overarching principles.\"-- Monica Prochnow\"Instructor is very active and involved with his students\"\"This course is great so far. Simple but professional while giving work I wouldn't have expected to encounter. I do have some questions for teacher (later) and from what I've seen, he is very active and involved with his students. I also like the extra resources. A good investment!\"-- Ashley Elijah\"Best course I've taken through Udemy\"\"Dr. Akinci shares his extensive knowledge of technical writing in a clear and easy to understand format. From learning about a document's structure to useful hints in Word, there's something for anyone looking to expand their writing skills. The final assignment allows students to put their learning to work right away. Receiving prompt feedback from Dr. Akinci is extremely helpful. He praises where you excel and highlights ways to further improve future documents. He's super encouraging! I've learned an amazing amount. Best course I've taken through Udemy.\"-- Laurie Trowbridge\"One of the best courses for beginners who want to be Technical Writers\"\"One of the best courses for beginners those who want to be \"Technical Writers\". Best teaching with lots of videos, assignments and explanation. It has helped me personally for developing my writing skills and learning the technical concepts for writing. Thank you for this course and I am glad that I was part of this course\".-- Jitendra Dahare\"One of the best in the technical writing field...\"\"Ugur Akinci does an excellent presentation and through delivery with notes and references. One of the best in the technical writing field. His past experience is certainly evident in the videos and supporting material.\"-- Ronald Nats\"... helped me recently get a full-time technical writing job\"\"Ugur's course was very helpful. It helped me recently get a full-time technical writing job.\" -- Loren Robinson \"Thorough, Useful, and Easy to Follow\"\"Dr. Akinci is an excellent instructor, in addition to being an accomplished technical writer. He guides the student through the very detailed, step-by-step process of producing user guides and technical manuals, and he does so with a friendly humour. Each lecture is an easily digested, bite-sized morsel. Aside from making the bits easy to learn, this also makes it easier to go back and find things later, if you need to check on something. I'd recommend this course to anyone with any interest in technical writing.\" -- Tamatha Campbell\"A must course for anyone who writes technical documents!\"\"I currently work as a BA, and decided to take this course to concentrate on the logistics of writing. This course has superseded my expectations! Technical writing isn’t simply writing well, but designing a professional document for the end user. For this, you need to know how to create the components of a technical document, indexing, graphs and tables, just to name a few (all of which are covered in this course). I considered myself a strong writer, but during the course, I realized that I was making common mistakes, changing from active to passive voice in my documents, assuming the end reader would understand my abbreviations, or acronyms, or writing noun trains…In this course you will learn everything you need to know (and in great detail) to write a technical document. This course is by far, the best course I have completed through Udemy.\"-- Jennifer Somerville\"A Worthwhile Investment...\"This is a comprehensive, well-organised and well-considered course. Chapter-by-chapter, you learn the wide range of skills required by a successful technical writer. The lectures are very informative and come with a huge amount of extra resources and materials which are available for download. It’s also a plus that course is constantly updated and the instructor is also available and highly responsive to his students.I’d highly recommend this course but it shouldn't be aimed at just those interested in pursuing a career in technical writing. Academics, students, business people – anyone who writes reports - will reap benefits from this course. I found it well worthwhile investing both my time and money in this course.\"-- Kathryn H.\"High Quality as Expected\"\"This course and professor's learning structure both serve as strengths to Udemy's catalog. I am satisfied by how much content that the professor provided, for the professional feedback that he directed toward our individual projects, and for the feeling of satisfaction to achieve a certificate and to potentially share our work with others. Thank you for piecing together a valuable educational experience!\"-- Phill Keck\"Great Technical Writing Course!\"\"Great course with great material! Ugur's insight and how he can relate real life scenarios to help teach the information in a way that makes it easier to learn and retain. Thanks Ugur!\" -- Lee Dinkins\"Great!!!! Great course for beginners or even experts!\"-- Nicholas Nelson \"Great course! The course is very helpful!\"\"The content is informative and comprehensive. Thank you!\"-- Mariia Zlatkova“Valuable\"\"I haven't finished my work yet, but I have found his course very helpful.\" – Michelle Daley“Excellent Course\"\"You course help me lot in my Daily Job. I am not a technical writer nor in the business of writing. But as a Project Engineer who prepared lots of technical reports and letters to client and contractors this course help me a lot. Most of the technical writing fundamentals given here are also applicable to my kind of Business writing. I could not make any product manual as I don't have any Product. Highly recommended to all those who wants to improve their Business Writing even though course is on technical writing.\" – Varun Patel“A very fine course!\"\"The course was very well delivered and lectures divided into sections and all sections contained important information and tips. Quizzes were just right for the task. Dr. Akinci presented the material clearly and competently. Moreover, he corrected the assignments promptly while providing a very thorough feed back.\"– Shaheda Rizvi“Take this Course!\"\"My name is, Justin Berg, I am a Product Manager for a web based EHR called MediTouch. I took this course to help with job responsibilities, but I wish I took this course in High School. I could have used the material from then and into the Future!

Through extensive illustrated text-based lectures and over 4 hours of over-the-shoulder, apprentice-style video tutorials, Tony offers the finest foundation material possible in here presenting \"Mastering 2D Animation\"! Each of Tony's tutorials embrace a comprehensive, step-by-step, apprentice-style of instruction, using both classically hand-drawn techniques and vector digital ones. Students should note that the core principles of movement taught in this course material however can always be applied to ALL forms of animation - from '3D' to 'Stop-frame', from 'Cut-out' to 'Claymation'!  (Note: The digital elements of this course are demonstrated using ToonBoom Studio. However, ToonBoom Technologies have since replaced 'Studio' with 'Harmony Essentials'. So students are strongly advised to obtain a rudimentary knowledge of this software before studying the digital aspects in this course. That way they will be better able to translate the 'Studio' instructions with the 'Harmony Essentials' ones without too much trouble.) Tony believes the 'apprenticeship' style of teaching is the ONLY way to really learn animation and that the instruction offered by some of the big, for-profit animation schools and colleges around the world is entirely inadequate for the modern professional world. Consequently, by literally drawing from his own early apprenticeship experiences with three of the finest master animators of all-time - Richard Williams (3 times Oscar winner), Ken Harris (Warner Brothers) & Art Babbit (Disney) - Tony has crafted here a series of unique and defining courses that are knowledgeable, accessible and perfectly suited to studies in a home-based environment.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/21526_e7a3_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-academy-animation-101/","language":"en","tags":["Design","3D & Animation","2D Animation"],"rating":4.6,"reviews":189,"isFree":false,"matches":["3774bfa1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37749899-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774bfa2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376f1a51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733900-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376dbac0-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c5b32-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ea526-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e7e12-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3778b742-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"mastering-2-d-animation"},{"id":"37720083-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19450","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.696Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"IP Subnetting Masterclass - Learn the Easy Way to Subnet","headline":"Learn subnetting in 15 seconds flat with my subnetting cheat sheet in this subnetting tutorial.","description":"Most IT Engineers Can’t Subnet…here’s why…Understanding IP Subnetting is a vital skill for every IT\nengineer and yet most don’t know how to do it or go about it completely the\nwrong way.

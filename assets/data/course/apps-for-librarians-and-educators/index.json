In this course, you'll become familiar with specific book apps in different categories, and learn how these apps are pushing the boundaries of the medium. We will NOT be discussing plain text titles available on the Kindle, Nook, & other platforms.

In each section of the course you'll watch video demos of particular interactive book apps, read several interesting articles and discuss everything in the class forums. There is a total of about 8-10 hours of work, which you can do at your own pace, with perpetual access. We'll have discussions about the future of the book as a medium. ● What do these changes mean for readers, libraries, authors, and publishers? ● What are the qualities of a delightful reading experience? ● How are these apps enabling learning and which features and qualities enable a the best experience for readers? A resource guide is included, with links to recommended book apps, additional readings, publishers to watch and blogs to follow.

Just take a look at Apple's documentation. This was just overly complicated for me! I wanted something simple and fast! Than I found MKStoreKit by Mugunth Kumar. MKStoreKit does all the magic of dealing with all that complicated stuff. Hurray!!! But, wait. I found no comprehensive MKStoreKit tutorial explaining how to use MKStoreKit.

It documents every step you have to make to learn in order to take advantage of in app monetization.

Expert trainer and published author Tony Bove introduces you to using the iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) and Xcode to build apps for the iPhone, iPad and Universal apps. Even if you have never programmed before or built apps before, by the end of this course you will be fully capable of building apps and submitting them to the App Store. Before you even start building an app, Tony takes you through what makes a good app, and the limitations you will face on the iPhone and iPad platforms. You will learn how to design a good user interface, how to use the iOS simulator, how to program in Xcode, and how an app runs. From there, you will jump right into building apps: designing the interface, including iAds in your app, animating, timing, and much more. You will also learn how to build iPad specific apps to take advantage of a larger screen and additional features. Finally, you will learn how to package your apps, and prepare them for submission to the app store. By the conclusion of this course you will be fully capable of designing, creating and submitting an app to the Apple App Store, using the iOS SDK and Xcode. The author has included working files, to allow you to work alongside him as he builds an app throughout this video tutorial.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/8416_140f_11.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/beginners-guide-to-iphone-ipad-app-creation/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Mobile Apps","iOS Development"],"rating":4,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["3773d548-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d977-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37724ea6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3771d975-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37716447-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae31-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3775d112-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770990-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"beginners-how-to-create-i-phone-and-i-pad-apps-zero-coding"}]}}

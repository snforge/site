to Build a Language-Tutoring Business on the Cloud","headline":"Become a \"Cloud-Tutor\" and learn to teach hundreds of paying language students in less than one hour a day.","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to privately tutor hundreds of languages students from anywhere in the world in less than one hour a day using just your Smartphone? Impossible...right?  Even 5 private students would mean running all over town 7 days a week to meet appointments and still make barely enough money to pay rent.  You could try Skype tutoring, but you'd still eat up your days re-scheduling cancelled appointments and creating activities to fill up the hours of face-time you have to spend with students. Well thanks to the social web revolution, the old ways of teaching language have become obsolete.  In this “How to Start a Tutoring Business” course, you will learn about the \"Cloud-Tutoring\" system Idahosa Ness uses to manage over 500 hundreds language students in less than one hour a day with his \"Flow Series Courses.\"  The system is centered around the sound-hosting service, Soundcloud. Soundcloud allows us to structure meaningful conversations around sound.  More specifically, it allows you as an educator to give valuable personal instruction to your students in a streamlined manner and on your own schedule. So throw out that scheduler join the league of profitable and location-independent \"Cloud-Tutors” and learn how to start a tutoring business.

Do you have your entire network in one subnet? Current trends dictate that everything is on the internet, hence huge volumes of traffic are going through your network, causing slow running times and increased vulnerability to threats. Thus, subnetting has become a “must” to protect your network.In this course, you will be presented with several modules that contain all you need to know about network subnetting. You will start with a review of numbering systems and LAN/WAN topics to reinforce prerequisite networking concepts and then deep-dive into IPV4 addressing and subnetting. You will learn how to extend your skills to subnet on the more recent IPv6 networks and you’ll gain a solid understanding of their advantages. You will also learn about classless and classful addressing systems and subnetting with a combination of lectures followed by labs to help you get hands-on.By the end of the course, you will have gained a thorough knowledge of subnetting concepts and the confidence to create any number and type of subnets suiting your own network environment.Please note: You should have a basic understanding of networking, computer numbering systems, and the OSI model before taking this course.About the AuthorBrian Rogalski is a technically sophisticated computer professional with “hands-on” information security and networking expertise.

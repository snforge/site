Your old-school promotion isn’t producing results, which doesn’t surprise you since you just read in the Harvard Business Review that traditional marketing is dead. And that’s not really news either, because you keep hearing about how people are trusting traditional advertising less and less and trusting peer/social recommendations more and more. You’ve tried growing your business with \"the aggregators,\" but a lot of those leads are low quality, all of them are \"cold\" by nature, and the prices for those services just keep going up. Size of Sphere = Size of Income? So, you find yourself in this place where you’ve maxed out your sphere of influence using traditional methods. And anyone who’s been in real estate longer than 5 minutes knows that the size of your sphere determines the size of your income. More connections = more money, right? New Life for Your Business And you think, “Those old, cold and expensive methods just aren’t working for me. I need to find a new way to expand my network and inject new life into my business.” And so, for all those reasons, you decide to give Twitter a try. And here’s what you discover: That Twitter users are the most active and dynamic in all of Social Media  That you can use keywords and laser-focused geo-targeting to connect with people right in your community That there’s not a lot of competition, because most people do the wrong things, get no results and blame Twitter for the lackluster ROI - when in reality the problem wasn't Twitter at all, but simply those people doing the wrong things That Twitter is exploding, and there are now nearly HALF A BILLION people using the platform Grow Your Network So, you start connecting with more and more people, growing your network every single day. You quickly realize that Twitter users love to engage and make new connections. And you discover a few things that you did not expect. That the learning curve is not that steep. And that Twitter is actually fun. Yes, FUN! You nurture along hundreds of relationships, building and building a little bit more each and every week. And you wake up one day and realize that you’ve expanded your network dramatically while doing 99% of it at home in front of your computer. Or from your smart phone or you iPad. And you realize that what you heard was actually true: that Twitter really is the greatest relationship creation machine of all time. And you think, \"I only wish I had started using Twitter sooner.\" Take this course and let me show you how to grow your sphere of influence using Twitter.... PS: This course isn't going to be ideally suited to all personalities or communication styles. If you purchase this course and feel even a smidgen of disappointment, Udemy will give you your money back, so long as it's within the first 30 days, no questions asked. PPS: Here is some \"Social Proofing\" I've received from a myriad of key players in the real estate industry.  PPPS: Here is what happened when an industry VIP followed my advice and dramatically improved his Twitter experience quickly.

Growing your customer base to achieve higher sales.","description":"In my Niche Marketing class you will discover how a streamlined niche marketing strategy will help you to grow your customer base who is ready to buy from you. It doesn't matter if you sell products or services.To succeed in promoting your business, it is important that you do not waste your marketing budget on unfruitful exercises. You do not want to waste your marketing efforts on the wrong people, especially those people who could not afford your product or services, or even those who would not buy your service or product anyway no matter how hard you may try.Many people mistakenly believe that marketing any type of business means having to pay for online or newspaper adverts and the buyers will come and buy. While this would be fantastic, in reality though this approach just doesn't work long time, if at all. And before you come to realise this, your marketing budget will be depleated and you will come to the realisation that your 'business has failed'.It's time to rethink your approach and accept the fact that whatever you offer, products or services, will only appeal to a defined niche market. Let's say you are selling apples, then anyone who doesn't like apples will not buy from you, even though they may have seen your advert. This is the dilemma you need to address, which is done through targeted advertising to a niche market - ultimately the market in which you operate.My niche marketing class is full of valuable tips and advice which makes it easy for everyone to develop a marketing strategy that works and which helps to grow your customer base and business as a whole.I also share with you the 5-step niche marketing method which includes:Identifying and targeting your niche marketHow to find your niche marketCollecting testimonialsHow to create niche marketing materials for your businessWays of how to contact your niche marketRemember: Niche Marketing does not need to be scary or difficult.All you need to do is to put into practice what you have learned.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/20752_d801_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/expand-your-customer-base-by-narrowing-your-marketing-focus/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Marketing Fundamentals","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":4.3,"reviews":22,"isFree":false,"matches":["377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b8-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"niche-marketing-made-easy"},{"id":"37722797-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"19958","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.698Z","updated":"2012-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Winning Sales Script System for Sales and Marketing","headline":"Learn how to build a winning sales script system to close more sales, today.","description":"","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/19958_c3cd_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing/","language":"en","tags":["Business","Sales","Sales Skills"],"rating":4,"reviews":11,"isFree":false,"matches":["37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3777cce4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb79-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377275b6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742360-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377730a4-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376cf772-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37781b02-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"winning-sales-script-system-for-sales-and-marketing"},{"id":"37718b50-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"18569","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.692Z","updated":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Professional Selling","headline":"Anyone can learn how to become more persuasive and how to deliver a professional quality sales presentation.","description":"Sales is a critical function for any business.  It provides the revenue that pays for everything else the company does.  Professional level sales people make six-figure incomes and interact with billion dollar companies, like Walmart and Kroger.

There are a lot of great reasons to use online content to market your business - you can attract more traffic, establish your expertise and earn the trust that turns your website's visitors into customers. Heck, even Google changed their search engine so that sites with great content float to the top of their search results pages. However, creating content can be challenging. It takes time. Not everyone enjoys writing and many folks just don't like to write at all. Writing content for website means trouble to them! But what if there was a way to quickly and easily create the kind of content that attracts your target customers? What if you could use that content to build so much credibility, authority and trust that potential customers are driven to take action by buying your products and services, following you on social media sites and signing-up to get your newsletters? And, what if doing this was easier than what you're trying to do now? It's all possible with content curation. Content curation doesn't do away with the writing, but it does make web content writing easier to quickly create powerful content that will: ● Bring more traffic to your site ● Increase the number of your social media fans and followers ● Build your e-mail marketing list ● Establish you as a top \"go-to\" expert in your industry ● Keep you on top of your target customer's mind ● Earn you good karma (and \"social credit\") from your peers ● Increase sales What's that? You think content curation is the lazy man's way to do inbound marketing? Well, if you just listed a bunch of links, I would say that you're right. But content curation is much more than that. Content curation is all about adding value to the links you curate and this course teaches you -- using step-by-step videos, worksheets and templates -- how to do just that. The course is split into four parts: 1 Content curation overview and examples: teaches you what content curation is, why you should use it and how you can use it; 2 Creating content curated content: how to choose topics to curate, how to find and select content for each topic, how to add value to the content you find and how to construct the actual content; 3 Content curation tips-and-tricks: a couple of handy lessons on extending the value of content curation; and 4 Putting content curation into action: how to get started using content curation to start writing website content and blow up your business. But wait, there's more! I've also included a bonus video that teaches you all about inbound marketing and a content curated document which is all about content curation. The best thing about this course: You can use it to quickly create powerful content, content that brings customers to your site and drives them to take action, again and again and again and again and (well, you get the idea)... p.s.

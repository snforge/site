If you are disconnected from yourself and your core, you'll never be happy and fulfilled. You can try every diet, go on every spiritual path, but if you don't come to a point of being in tune with your deepest thoughts and feelings, you will always feel a lack in your life. In this “Self Love: Learn How to Love Yourself” course, you will get 10 videos, 9 audio files and 9 text messages that guide you on your journey to loving yourself more. You will move your body, change your habits, take a look at your destructive beliefs, go deep within to see what you truly yearn for and so much more. The Self Love: Learn How to Love Yourself course will take 28 days to complete, but you can also do it at your own pace. With this course your thoughts will become clearer, your feelings will become less hateful and your actions will become more loving. If you're searching for a fun way to find your way back to yourself, then this Self Love: Learn How to Love Yourself is the course for you.   Imagine that in 28 short days you've created a strong self-care routine, helping you to have an intimate and loving relationship with the person you are. Imagine how incredible it would feel to know that you are worthy, lovable and deserving of all the happiness in the world. Imagine what it would feel like to know that you don’t have to change, lose weight or negate your true nature to completely accept yourself. You're not that far away from that reality right now. Now on the other hand imagine what would happen if you never stepped up and made yourself a priority. Imagine how your life would be impacted. Imagine how much more pain or despair you’d remain in if you, yes YOU, didn't take action and unabashedly loved yourself in the way only you know how. Imagine the suffering that would be created by you not doing this. So, what'll it be? Which choice will you make? Take this Self Love course and learn how to love yourself. </p>","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/28437_0185_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/28-loving-reawakenings/","language":"en","tags":["Personal Development","Self Esteem","Love"],"rating":4.8,"reviews":5,"isFree":false,"matches":["37749893-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711620-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377582f5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6b7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773ae34-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37795388-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711627-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3774e6ba-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"28-loving-re-awakenings"},"related":[{"id":"37795388-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"2748920","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:08.094Z","updated":"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Moms are Amazing: Feel calmer, de-stress, tone and stretch","headline":"For Busy Moms who want to recharge their batteries","description":"Are you a mom who needs to de-stress, feel good about yourself, but you don't have time?

Yoga teacher and Radical Transformational Therapist Teagan Fea and music composer Angel Sananda will take you on an incredible Meditation journey for 10 weeks, a journey that could change your life. Are you aching to connect with yourself and do you want to be nourished and nurtured emotionally, mentally and spiritually? Now you can. Most people I meet feel a deep need to connect more fully with themselves. They find it difficult however because of their commitments. They may find time to catch a yoga class or go to the gym however they still feel that they are rushing from one thing to the next. Learn to find peace and stillness in every day. My yoga teacher once told me that life is about relationships. She was right. But the fundamental relationship we don't focus on is our relationship to self. When we spend time in spiritual practice on a daily basis, we nurture the soul, our creativity and ultimately our relationships with others. We learn to experience a level of peace that is so fulfilling it profoundly changes our lives. This Program Includes... 10 MP3 meditations10 videos & supporting PDFsDaily reflections Each week you will listen to an MP3 meditation. Each meditation is between 15-25 minutes long. You will also have access to supporting information including videos and PDFs and details about the practice for that day. The topics covered over the 10 weeks are as follows: Week 1: Letting go Week 2: Balancing the energy centres Week 3: Breath awareness Week 4: Embodied awareness Week 5: Connecting with the heart Week 6: Developing presence Week 7: Connecting with the divine feminine Week 8: Connection with the divine masculine Week 9: Intergrating both sides of your nature Week 10: Cultivating joy and abundance Each day you will receive an intention to focus on for that day. The intention will help to keep you in the retreat zone. Here's what others say about this program: \"I hope you do this program again because I would really love to recommend it to people. I would love to do more of this sort of work, so I hope you continue. I loved that it was so easy to access and brought new awareness and joy to my life. Great! Thank you so much for your support throughout the ten weeks\" LC Melbourne, Australia \"What a beautiful way to start the morning! Thank you so much for creating this.

Do you find yourself going days or weeks without laughing? I certainly used to. I was in a job I hated and that filled my head with negativity and my body with rigidity. In 1998 while in Mumbai, India, I read a newspaper article about a group of people that gathered every day in a nearby public park to laugh. It piqued my interest because they shared no jokes and didn't use any form of comedy. Instead they laughed purely for the sake of feeling good, just because. I was puzzled but chose not to go and investigate. It would have taken a full one hour, and I was too busy complaining I was too busy. I mean, why would sane adults do this anyway? What was the point? This was ridiculous and they had to be crazy. Anybody can laugh like that. Ha ha ha. Done. I quickly forgot about it all, and was so convinced I could laugh anytime anywhere that it took me 6 years to realize that I never did. Eventually my heart took me back to Mumbai and its laughter clubs. I learned to laugh every day as a yogic practice using an exercise regime created by a medical doctor in 1995 called Laughter Yoga. This was a big turning point for me. I discovered how good laughing could make me feel and how easy it was to laugh, even when everything in my life seemed to be going astray. It was so profound that it triggered a cataclysmic reaction in my brain. The mask fell. I stopped being who I thought I should be and started being who I really wanted to be. I learned to always take full responsibility for my actions and how they made me feel. This did not change my life. It still is much better than that. It changed me. The more I practiced and taught this exercise regime, the more I discovered complementary techniques that help to bring joy into everyday life. I also started to understand the underlying wisdom from both the East and the West that all these techniques pointed to. In time I combined this knowledge into a method that I call Laughter Wellness. It includes the Laughter Yoga approach of simulated laughter exercises, and expands its approach by offering a clear process that is easy to follow, and adding a greater variety of techniques and activities, insights, games, dances, songs and more – all glued together with lots of laughter. What's in it for you This introductory course will introduce to you the founding principles and key techniques of Laughter Yoga and the Laughter Wellness method, and how they can help you as an individual laugh more (we won't go into how to teach group sessions). It will remind you of the scientifically proven benefits of laughter. These are still best summarized by the quote in King James Bible \"A merry heart does good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.\" (Proverbs 17:22) It will help you remember how easy it is to laugh, and how good it can make you feel. You will learn many ways and techniques to create and maintain a personal and daily laughter practice. It will show you how to use laughter as a skillset to maintain a positive attitude even in the face of adversity, and redefine stress as a challenge, not a threat. It will share valuable insights on how to best use the power of your mind with the actions of your body to add more laughter and joy into your life, as well as become a better version of who you are. It will share valuable insights on how to achieve a healthy, happy and successful life from the ancient wisdom of Yoga and modern scientific findings from the world of positive psychology. Course requirements No particular equipment, clothing, or physical abilities are required. What your personal history is doesn't matter. Who you are now is perfect and most appropriate. All can practice and benefit, with or without limbs, because this method revolves primarily around the breath and attitude (it's of course going to be more fun if you have limbs because these allow for more movements.) All you need is a big smile and the willingness to try something new that only adds and doesn't take anything away. This is a \"yes, and\" approach to life, not \"yes, but.\" My goal is not to persuade you of anything, but rather to make you conscious of what is available to you. As Zig Ziglar once said, \"no man is clever enough to remember everything he knows.\" There is always value in being reminded of what's important.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/17789_c1d8_6.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/laughter/","language":"en","tags":["Health & Fitness","Yoga"],"rating":4.8,"reviews":12,"isFree":false,"matches":["376b70d3-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ad490-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37770994-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3772eae5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37742363-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37733905-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37736017-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377311f2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3773fc51-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37711627-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"the-yoga-of-laughter-from-stressed-out-to-blissed-out"}]}}

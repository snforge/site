Topics covered will include but not be limited to: Syntax and commands Creating variables Creating methods Working with files Exception handling Creating Classes Object-Oriented programming basics Basic Unit Testing Graphics and GUI programming In the end, this course is a stand-alone course, however it would be a huge aid to the online student who is taking a self-directed course, an individual who is trying to learn how to program, or even a high school student looking to get a head start on computer science material they might encounter in college. The material is organized in a start-to-finish fashion, building on knowledge with each section, so it is best to proceed through each section in order. Each section should amount to about a week worth of learning, lining up with most popular online course formats. Additionally, the course works hard to build practical knowledge that will help a student excel in their coursework, and also builds a strong foundation for a start to a career in programming for anyone looking to learn! As an added bonus, several useful programs are built throughout this course, and the end result of the course includes full source code for a working Sudoku game, amongst other programs, such as card game score calculators and basics physics formula calculation programs.

Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, you’ll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, you’ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, you’ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

Spring Boot 2.x, a feature-rich platform built from the Spring 5.x framework, is created by to help developers solve their complex problems with fewer configurations but with strong dependency management features.In this course, you will learn how to create various modules in a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) such as employee timesheets, leave management, and profiling. You will use Spring Boot 2.x to create your HRIS app while integrating Spring Web MVC, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data, RESTful web services, and clients. Above all, you'll use the latest version of Spring Security—5.0—to secure your apps and OAuth 2.x to implement an OpenID connection. You'll apply reactive programming with its Spring Web Flux and Project Reactor features. Finally, you will deploy your apps and services using some popular cloud and container platforms such as Spring Cloud Foundry, Docker, and AWS.By the end of the course, you will be confident in implementing the core features of Spring Boot 2.x to create scalable, optimal, and robust enterprise web applications.About the AuthorSherwin John Calleja Tragura started his career as a Java developer by focusing on the Documentum and Alfresco document management systems.

Topics covered will include but not be limited to: Syntax and commands Creating variables Creating methods Working with files Exception handling Creating Classes Object-Oriented programming basics Basic Unit Testing Graphics and GUI programming In the end, this course is a stand-alone course, however it would be a huge aid to the online student who is taking a self-directed course, an individual who is trying to learn how to program, or even a high school student looking to get a head start on computer science material they might encounter in college. The material is organized in a start-to-finish fashion, building on knowledge with each section, so it is best to proceed through each section in order. Each section should amount to about a week worth of learning, lining up with most popular online course formats. Additionally, the course works hard to build practical knowledge that will help a student excel in their coursework, and also builds a strong foundation for a start to a career in programming for anyone looking to learn! As an added bonus, several useful programs are built throughout this course, and the end result of the course includes full source code for a working Sudoku game, amongst other programs, such as card game score calculators and basics physics formula calculation programs.

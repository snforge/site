Also included is a complete database of websites to use for your online marketing campaign as well as a basic online marketing plan for any small business. The videos range in length from one minute to approximately nine minutes and are divided into two categories: lecture style and hands-on. The lecture style videos feature the course founder, Tom Aikins, explaining the principles of a particular subject. Then, the hands-on videos that immediately follow these videos show step-by-step how the particular technique or application is done using a screen capture program. These videos show viewers where to click and exactly what to do as the particular operation is being demonstrated and they can view the instructor’s computer screen exactly as it appears so the learning process is simple and easy to follow. This product, in following with Google’s continuing attempts to more and more engage small business owners, was created for people who have small- to medium-sized businesses and have a website that is not effective in generating sales for them. The types of business that can benefit from the OME course is almost limitless. Covering service businesses, professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc), retailers, food service, manufacturing and any others that need more traffic from their website, the OME training course can help any of these businesses improve their website traffic. And please don't forget that this includes a database of websites that are critical for use in online marketing. The cost of compiling this database yourself would be greater than the cost of the entire course. Updates to the database will also be sent to subscribers as new websites are found and tested.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/14728_4e83_3.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/online-marketing-excellence/","language":"en","tags":["Marketing","Search Engine Optimization","Marketing Strategy"],"rating":0,"reviews":0,"isFree":false,"matches":["37720089-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769460-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770c804-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","377534d9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722795-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37729cc5-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb71-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37769461-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff1-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37722798-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"online-marketing-excellence"},{"id":"376e2ff2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"13888","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.177Z","updated":"2012-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Adobe Captivate 5 Training for Beginners","headline":"Adobe Captivate 5 Training for Beginners","description":"Welcome to the Udemy Captivate Training: Adobe Captivate Tutorial for Beginners Online Training Course.

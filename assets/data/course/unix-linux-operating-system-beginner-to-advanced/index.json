In this C# for Beginners tutorial course, you can learn this powerful object-oriented programming language so closely tied to Microsoft .NET and see why it is such a great platform for creating rich applications. Professor Mike McMillan goes through the fundamentals of the language structure, and gradually lays the groundwork for you to build your own apps. In 114 separate tutorials, Mike gives you a solid working knowledge of object-oriented programming, even if youâ€™re completely new to coding. He demonstrates how to use variables and data types, objects and classes, arrays, inheritance and polymorphism and distinguishes how working in C# differs from other types of code. Once you gain your confidence in the underlying areas, youâ€™ll be ready to complete the functional To-Do List app that is integrated into the course.","image":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/11152_b642_7.jpg","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/c-sharp-for-beginners/","language":"en","tags":["Development","Programming Languages","C#"],"rating":4.5,"reviews":309,"isFree":false,"matches":["376e7e11-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37738723-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376e2ff9-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37750dc6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376ca951-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","376de1d7-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","37777ec2-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3776bb74-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","3770a0f6-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a"],"slug":"learning-c-net-programming-for-beginners"},{"id":"376c3421-3ef1-11ea-9791-1b580a556b4a","vendorId":"9463","created":"2020-01-24T21:35:07.173Z","updated":"2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Programming Java for Beginners - The Ultimate Java Tutorial","headline":"Learn Java Programming at your own Pace. Comes Complete with Working Files and a Verifiable Certificate of Completion.","description":" Learn the basic concepts, tools, and functions that you will need to build fully functional programs with the popular programming language, Java. Build a strong foundation in Java and object-oriented programming with this tutorial for beginners. Java Development Kit Installation Types and Operators Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, and Objects Loops and Conditionals A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips Learning the fundamentals of Java puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Java is free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all object-oriented programming languages. Jobs in java development are plentiful, and being able to learn Java will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Ruby, and Pascal. Content and Overview Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 115 lectures and 10 hours of content, youâ€™ll learn all of the Java fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming (OOP). Each chapter closes with exercises, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the Java Development Kit, this course will take you through Java variable types, operators, and how to use them. By creating classes and objects, youâ€™ll a establish a strong understanding of OOP. With these basics mastered, the course will take you through program flow control by teaching you how to use for loops, while loops, and conditional if-else statements to add complexity and functionality to your programs. Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Java programs. Complete with working files and code samples, youâ€™ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.
